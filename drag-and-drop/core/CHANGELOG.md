## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [`90901f5bbe0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/90901f5bbe0) - Replace default entry point of `undefined` with `{}`.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1ecbb19d450`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1ecbb19d450) - Adding a new function to make creating _custom_ native drag previews safe and easy: `setCustomNativeDragPreview`

  ```tsx
  import { setCustomNativeDragPreview } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/set-custom-native-drag-preview';

  draggable({
    element: myElement,
    onGenerateDragPreview: ({ nativeSetDragImage }) => {
      setCustomNativeDragPreview({
        render: function render({ container }) {
          ReactDOM.render(<Preview item={item} />, container);
          return function cleanup() {
            ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
          };
        },
        nativeSetDragImage,
      });
    },
  });
  ```

  Please see our element adapter documentation for more detailed usage information

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [`9c0975e2fab`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/9c0975e2fab) - Bug fix: A _monitor_ should not be called after it is removed. Previously, if a _monitor_ (monitor 1) removed another _monitor_ (monitor 2) for the same event, then the second monitor (monitor 2) would still be called. This has been fixed

  ```ts
  const cleanupMonitor1 = monitorForElements({
    onDragStart: () => {
      cleanupMonitor2();
    },
  });
  const cleanupMonitor2 = monitorForElements({
    // Previously this `onDragStart` would have been called during `onDragStart` even though it was unbound by the first monitor
    onDragStart: () => {},
  });
  ```

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [`03e0aa5ae85`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/03e0aa5ae85) - `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` adds event listeners to the `window` during a drag operation. These drag operation event listeners were [`bubble` phase event listeners](https://domevents.dev/), but they are now `capture` phase event listeners to be more resliant against external code (incorrectly) stopping events.

  This does not impact the ability of a consumer to have their own `draggable`s on a page not controlled by `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop`

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [`6455cf006b3`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6455cf006b3) - Builds for this package now pass through a tokens babel plugin, removing runtime invocations of the tokens() function and improving performance.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1e3f9743e57`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1e3f9743e57) - A _monitor_ that is added during an event (eg `onDragStart`) will no longer be called for the current event. This is to prevent the accidental creation of infinite loops. This behaviour matches native [`EventTargets`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) where an event listener cannot add another event listener during an active event to the same event target in the same event phase.

### Minor Changes

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`52403a2c11f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/52403a2c11f) - Adding a `canMonitor()` function to _monitors_ to allow a _monitor_ to conditionally apply to a drag operation.

  ```ts
  monitorForElements({
    canMonitor: ({ source }) => source.data.type === 'card',
    onDragStart: () =>
      console.log('I will only be activated when dragging a card!'),
  });
  ```
