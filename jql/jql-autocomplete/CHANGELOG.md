# @atlaskit/jql-autocomplete

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`ef15cb77a2a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/ef15cb77a2a) - Migrate `jql-autocomplete` package to the `@atlaskit` namespace. Any consumers should update their imports to `@atlaskit/jql-autocomplete`.
- We are moving the `jql-autocomplete` package from `@atlassiansox` and `@atlassianlabs` namespaces to `@atlaskit`. From now on,
there will be a single publish to the public npm registry, and any imports should be updated to `@atlaskit/jql-autocomplete`. We are keeping the changelog for older versions in CHANGELOG.old.md, for historical reasons.
