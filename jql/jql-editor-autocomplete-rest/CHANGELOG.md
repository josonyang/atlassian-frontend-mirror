# @atlaskit/jql-editor-autocomplete-rest

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`801e874de87`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/801e874de87) - Migrate `jql-editor-common` and `jql-editor-autocomplete-rest` packages to the `@atlaskit` namespace. Any consumers should update their imports to `@atlaskit/jql-editor-common` and `@atlaskit/jql-editor-autocomplete-rest`.
We've moved the `jql-editor-autocomplete-rest` package from `@atlassiansox` and `@atlassianlabs` namespaces to `@atlaskit`. From now on, there will be a single publish to the public npm registry, and any imports should be updated to `@atlaskit/jql-editor-autocomplete-rest`. We are keeping the changelog for older versions in the CHANGELOG.old.md file, for historical reasons.
