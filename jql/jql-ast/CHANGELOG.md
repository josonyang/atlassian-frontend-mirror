# @atlaskit/jql-ast

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`9b4a9aa9793`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/9b4a9aa9793) - Migrate `jql-ast` package to the `@atlaskit` namespace. Any consumers should update their imports to `@atlaskit/jql-ast`.
We've moved the `jql-ast` package from `@atlassiansox` and `@atlassianlabs` namespaces to `@atlaskit`. From now on,
there will be a single publish to the public npm registry, and any imports should be updated to `@atlaskit/jql-ast`. We are keeping the changelog for older versions in the CHANGELOG.old.md file
