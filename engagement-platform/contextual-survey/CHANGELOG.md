  [ux] Migrated from `@emotion/react` to `@compiled/react` in order to improve performance, align
  with the rest of the Atlaskit techstack, and support React 18 Sttreaming SSR. Please note, in
  order to use this version of @atlaskit/contextual-survey, you will need to ensure that your

  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.

### Major Changes

- [major][271b7db35b](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/271b7db35b):

  _💥 Most of the changes listed are breaking changes from the 0.x release_

  ### New component for placement: `<SurveyMarshal />`

  We no longer require consumers to know anything about `react-transition-group` to use this
  package. The `<SurveyMarshal />` takes care of the placement and mounting / unmounting animation
  of the component. It accepts a _function as a child_ which needs to return the
  `<ContextualSurvey />`. This pattern also allows the `<ContextualSurvey />` to not be evaluated
  when it is not mounted

  ```js
  import { SurveyMarshal, ContextualSurvey } from '@atlaskit/contextual-survey';

  <SurveyMarshal shouldShow={showSurvey}>{() => <ContextualSurvey />}</SurveyMarshal>;
  ```

  ### Other

  - `getUserHasAnsweredMailingList: () => boolean | () => Promise<boolean>` has been streamlined to
    just be `() => Promise<boolean>`.
  - ~~`onSignUp() => Promise<void>`~~ has become `onMailingListAnswer(answer) => Promise<void>`.
    Previously `onSignUp` was only called if the user selected they wanted to sign up.
    `onMailingListAnswer` will be called when the user selects they want to sign up, as well as if
    they select that they do not want to sign up.
  - 💄 `<ContextualSurvey />` now animates in as well as out
  - 💄 No more scrollbars during closing animation
  - 💄 Fixing spacing for `FeedbackAcknowledgement` screen
  - 💄 Audit dismiss button alignment
  - 🛠Preventing double calls to `onDismiss()`
  - 🛠`onDismiss()` now provided with a `enum:DismissTrigger` to give more information about the
    reason for the dismiss
  - 🛠If `<ContextualSurvey />` is dismissed while `onSubmit` is resolving, then
    `getUserHasAnsweredMailingList()` is not called. We do this as we won't be showing the email
    sign up
  - 🛠If the user marks that they do not want to be contacted, then
    `getUserHasAnsweredMailingList()` is not called. Previously `getUserHasAnsweredMailingList()`
    was always called _regardless_ of whether the user wanted to be contacted. The email sign up is
    only showed if the user states that they want to be contacted and if
    `getUserHasAnsweredMailingList` returns `false`. We now don't call
    `getUserHasAnsweredMailingList` if the user has stated they don't want to be contacted as it is
    a precondition.
  - 🚀 The user is able to dismiss the form at any time using the `escape` key
  - 🕵️‍ After clicking a score the response `textarea` is given browser focus.
  - ✅ New behaviour for the _can contact_ checkbox. It is now not selected by default. When a user
    types into the response text area for the first time we swap it to checked. From that point the
    user is welcome to change it's value and we do not automatically swap it to checked again. This
    allows people to select a score but not be contacted for it. It also recognises that the
    engagement platform would like to be able to respond to people who provide feedback.
  - ♿️ Added `aria-pressed` to currently selected score
  - 📖 Documentation explaining application flow
  - 👩‍🔬 Added automated test for happy path
  - ❌ No longer exporting `surveyWidth` and `surveyMargin`. All placement is handled by
    `<SurveyMarshal />`
