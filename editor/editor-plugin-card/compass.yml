name: '@atlaskit/editor-plugin-card'
description: |-
  This is an editor plugin for Atlassian's rich text editor that enables support for "smart cards" and advanced linking features within the editor. It integrates with the Atlassian linking platform to allow users to insert, display, and interact with rich link previews (smart cards) directly in the editor surface.
  This plugin is typically consumed via `@atlaskit/editor-core` as a plugin dependency and is essential for products that require embedding and managing smart links in their content.
