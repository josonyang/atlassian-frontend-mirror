  [ux] Introduces advanced code block as per:
  https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDITOR/pages/4632293323/Editor+RFC+063+Advanced+code+blocks.
  This can be added to an existing editor preset to enrich the code block experience with syntax
  highlighting and can be extended for other features via CodeMirror extensions (ie. autocompletion,
  code folding etc.).
