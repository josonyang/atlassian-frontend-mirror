# Editor plugin Editor ViewMode Effects

ViewMode Effeects plugin for @atlaskit/editor-core

This plugin exists to remove dependencies from editor-plugin-viewmode and should probably be
rethought along with how the existing set of core dependencies fit together in the future.

**Note:** This component is designed for internal Atlassian development. External contributors will
be able to use this component but will not be able to submit issues.
