# Editor plugin avatar group

Avatar Group plugin for @atlaskit/editor-core

The avatar-group plugin is just a placeholder for the AvatarsWithPluginState component so that it is properly integrated into the toolbar.
The avatar-group plugin itself doesn't do anything so all the pm-plugin related code has been removed.

**Note:** This component is designed for internal Atlassian development.
External contributors will be able to use this component but will not be able to submit issues.
