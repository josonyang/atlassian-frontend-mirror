/**

 *
 * Debounces and replaces the node views in a ProseMirror editor with lazy-loaded node views.
 *
 * This function is used to update the `nodeViews` property of the `EditorView` after lazy-loaded
 * node views have been loaded. It uses a debounced approach to ensure that the replacement does
 * not happen too frequently, which can be performance-intensive.
 *
 * The function checks if there are any loaded node views in the cache associated with the given
 * `EditorView`. If there are, it replaces the current `nodeViews` in the `EditorView` with the
 * loaded node views. The replacement is scheduled using `requestIdleCallback` or
 * `requestAnimationFrame` to avoid blocking the main thread, especially in Firefox where
 * `requestIdleCallback` may not be supported.
 *
 * @param {WeakMap<EditorView, Record<string, NodeViewConstructor>>} cache - A WeakMap that stores
 *        the loaded node views for each `EditorView`. The key is the `EditorView`, and the value
 *        is a record of node type names to their corresponding `NodeViewConstructor`.
 * @param {EditorView} view - The ProseMirror `EditorView` instance whose `nodeViews` property
 *        needs to be updated.
 *
 * @example
 * const cache = new WeakMap();
 * const view = new EditorView(...);
 *
 * // Assume some node views have been loaded and stored in the cache
 * cache.set(view, {
 *   'table': TableViewConstructor,
 *   'tableCell': TableCellViewConstructor,
 * });
 *
 * debouncedReplaceNodeviews(cache, view);
