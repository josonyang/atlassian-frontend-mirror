  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.
