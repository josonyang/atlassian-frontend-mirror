name: '@atlaskit/linking-common'
description: |-
  This is a shared utility package within Atlassian’s Linking Platform. It provides common types, interfaces, and functionality that are used across multiple linking-related components and packages, such as Smart Links, link pickers, and link providers. Its main purpose is to centralize and standardize code that is reused throughout the linking ecosystem, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.
  Historically, this package also included "extractors" — utility functions for extracting metadata from links — but these have been deprecated and moved to a dedicated package, `@atlaskit/link-extractors`, to reduce upgrade friction and simplify dependencies for consumers.
