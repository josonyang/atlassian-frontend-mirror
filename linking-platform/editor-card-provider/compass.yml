description: |-
  This is a package that provides the `EditorCardProvider` component and related utilities for integrating Atlassian Smart Links (cards) into Atlassian editors. It acts as the main interface between the editor and the Linking Platform, enabling features such as link resolution, embedding, and rendering of rich Smart Links within the editor experience.
  This package was introduced to replace the deprecated `EditorCardProvider` and `editorCardProvider` exports from `@atlaskit/link-provider` and `@atlaskit/smart-card`, consolidating all editor-specific card provider logic into a dedicated package. Consumers should migrate to `@atlaskit/editor-card-provider` for future compatibility and ongoing support.
