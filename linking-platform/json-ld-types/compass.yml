description:
  This library provides type definitions for the [Atlassian Object
  Vocabulary](https://product-fabric.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SL/pages/460753040/Atlassian+Object+Vocabulary+JSON-LD)
  in JSON-LD format. It defines the standard structure and fields for JSON-LD data objects used
  across Atlassian's Smart Links and Linking Platform. These types ensure consistency and type
  safety when working with linked data objects, such as those rendered by Smart Links in Jira,
  Confluence, and other Atlassian products.
