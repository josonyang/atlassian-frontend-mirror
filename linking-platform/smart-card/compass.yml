description: |-
  This is a React component library that provides the UI and functionality for displaying Smart Linksâ€”enriched link previews that show contextual information about URLs from Atlassian products (like Jira, Confluence, Trello) and popular third-party services (such as GitHub, Google Drive, and more).
  When a supported link is pasted or inserted, the Smart Card component fetches and displays rich metadata, such as titles, thumbnails, status, and actions, offering a more informative and interactive experience than plain hyperlinks.
