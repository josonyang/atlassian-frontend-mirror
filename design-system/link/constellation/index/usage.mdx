## Usage

Links help users navigate to another page or sections of a page. They can also download files or
provide contact information such as phone numbers or email addresses.

1. **Label:** Text describing the link. Clearly describe where the link navigates or it's purpose.
1. **Icon (optional):** If the the link opens in a new window, an icon will be automatically
   displayed as an indicator.

If the icon is not desired, reconsider if the link should open in a new window. Links that open new
windows without warning can be disorienting for users.

## Accessibility

### Don't use subtle links when surrounded by regular text

The default link appearance has an underline and color, making it distinguishable from regular text
which is an accessibility requirement. Don't use 'subtle' appearance links in this context, as they
are difficult to differentiate from regular text.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: link1Do,
		alt: 'A link using the default appearance, surrounded by regular text. The default appearance provides color and an underline to differentiate the link from regular text.',
	}}
>
	Use the default link appearance when surrounded by regular text.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: link1Dont,
		alt: 'A link using the subtle appearance, surrounded by regular text. The subtle appearance is difficult to differentiate the link from regular text.',
	}}
>
	Use the subtle link appearance when surrounded by regular text.
</DoDont>

### Don't use subtle links unless other context already indicates it's a link

Only use the 'subtle' appearance if the surrounding context makes it clear that it's a link, such as
in navigation or breadcrumbs.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: link2Do,
		alt: 'Links in a navigation section. The links use the subtle appearance, which is appropriate because the surrounding context makes it clear that they are links.',
	}}
>
	Use the subtle appearance when surrounding context makes it clear it's a link.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: link2Dont,
		alt: 'Links in a navigation section. The links use the default appearance, which is not required because the surrounding context makes it clear that they are links.',
	}}
>
	Use the default appearance when surrounding context already makes it clear it's a link.
</DoDont>
