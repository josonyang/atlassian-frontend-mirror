## Usage

Links help users navigate to another page or sections of a page. They can also download files or
provide contact information such as phone numbers or email addresses.

## Accessibility

### Don't use subtle links unless other context already indicates it is a link

Link has an underline by default but it is disabled for subtle appearance links. Underlines help
differentiate links from regular text and addresses a WCAG-A recommendation. Using color alone isn't
accessible, especially if links are surrounded by other text.

Only use the subtle appearance if the context surrounding the link makes it clear that it is
interactive, such as in navigation or breadcrumbs.

Also, don't underline text that isn't a link. This makes the text look clickable because it looks a
link.

['Understanding Use of Color (Level A)'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html)
and
['Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to creating links that are not visually evident without color vision'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F73).

<!-- TODO: Add do/dont images once designed (if necessary?) -->

<DoDont type="do">
	Use underlined links in body copy. Only omit an underline if the context makes it clear the link
	is selectable.
</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">Use underlined links in navigation.</DoDont>

### Use descriptive link text that clarifies the purpose of the link

Don't link vague words or phrases like “here” or “learn more.” Make sure the linked text clearly
describes the purpose of the link.

<!-- TODO: Add some Do/Don't images as examples -->

<DoDont type="do">Clearly describe the purpose of the link.</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">Link vague words or phrases.</DoDont>

### Only open links in a new window or tab when necessary

Opening links in a new window can be disorienting for people, so only do it when necessary.

It might make sense for a link to open in a new window if:

- There's a risk of someone losing their current place or task
- The link takes the person out of the current product or to an external website

For more information see
['G200: Opening new windows and tabs from a link only when necessary'](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html).

### Keep links large enough to interact with

Make link text size at least 12px. Smaller text is harder to read and interact with.

## Best practices

### Don't confuse links and buttons

Links are for navigation and URL changes, while buttons are for on-page actions such as form
submissions or opening modals. These elements are treated differently by assistive technologies, so
avoid using one in place of the other.

[when to use links and buttons](/components/button/usage#use-buttons-for-actions-and-links-for-navigation).

## Content guidelines

### Use clear and unique link text

Try not to repeat the same link text over and over on a page. Make sure link text is clear about
where the link will go.

### Specify download links, including file type and size

Always specify if a link triggers a download, and make the linked text clear about what exactly will
be downloaded. Include file type and size as well.

### Don't include unnecessary links

Using too many links can overwhelm other, more important information on a page.

Links take people to a new page or location. Be mindful of whether or not the linked resource is
helpful or distracting to the current task.

### Links in sentences or body copy

Only link the words that are necessary to clarify where the link goes. Don't link the entire
sentence. (Linking smaller phrases can be better for internationalization when sentence structures
change across languages.)

Only include the verb in the linked text if it better describes the purpose the link or
differentiates it from other links and actions on the page.

For example:

> Update [Jira settings](/components/button/usage#use-buttons-for-actions-and-links-for-navigation)
> to turn off notifications. To upgrade,
> [sign up for Jira](/components/button/usage#use-buttons-for-actions-and-links-for-navigation).

If only Jira was linked, it wouldn't be clear that this was a sign up page.

### Links on their own (UI elements or navigation)

For standalone links, link the whole phrase. Don't add punctuation.

These type of links typically follow general button or other label content rules (sentence case
capitalization, no punctuation, etc.)
