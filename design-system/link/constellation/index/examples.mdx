## Default

The default appearance of a link.

<Example Component={Default} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## Subtle

Use a subtle link if the default link appearance is too prominent. There is no underline in resting
state, but one appears on hover.

Ensure the surrounding context makes it clear that the link is interactive, such as in navigation or
breadcrumbs. Avoid using subtle links in body copy because they're hard to distinguish from the
surrounding text.

<Example Component={Subtle} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## Visited

Links that have been visited will display in a different color.

<Example Component={Visited} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## Links that open in a new window or tab

It's important to indicate when links open in new windows or tabs. An icon will display next to the
link, as well as visually hidden text "(opens new window)" for screen reader users.

Opening links in a new window can be disorienting for people, so only do it when necessary. For more
information see
['G200: Opening new windows and tabs from a link only when necessary'](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html).

<Example Component={NewWindow} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## In body text

Links work in body copy, and will wrap onto new lines if necessary.

<Example Component={BodyCopy} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## Inheriting font styles

Links will inherit font styles of surrounding text.

<Example Component={FontStyleInheritance} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## HTML attributes

Link passes through all valid HTML attributes to the underlying `<a>` element.

<Example Component={HtmlAttributes} packageName="@atlaskit/link" />

## Router links

Link supports automatic configuration of router link components through the `AppProvider`. Here's an
[example of the router link configuration for the anchor primitive](/components/primitives/anchor/examples#router-links).

## Event tracking

Link has utilities to make tracking events easier. Here's
[an example of tracking events with the anchor primitive](/components/primitives/anchor/examples#event-tracking).
