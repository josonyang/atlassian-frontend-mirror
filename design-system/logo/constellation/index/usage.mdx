## Usage

To make each Atlassian product logo clear and impactful, we anchored each of them in a core value,
benefit, or representation of the product. For example, in Jira Software, we started with a core
representation of code – brackets. We worked the shape and style of this symbol, creating a mark
that represents teams working in iterative cycles.

### Color

It's important to be mindful of the context of logos and their usage.

Inside our products, Atlassian product logos work best on surface tokens such as `color.surface` or
bold backgrounds such as `color.background.brand.bold`.

### Types

There are two types of product logos: the lockup and logomark.

#### Lockup

Lockups include both the logomark and product name. These are used in global navigation, signup, and
login.

#### Logomark

Logomark doesn’t include the product name and is used in icon style UI. Use sparingly.

## Accessibility

Always include the product or brand name in alternative text when using a logomark or logo lockup.

Don’t include the word ‘logo’ in the alternative text. Instead, describe what the logo is for. For
example, if a logo is being used as a link in the header, the alt text could be ‘Go to the Atlassian
home page.’

### Atlaskit labeling

Don’t include the word ‘logo’ in the logo label. Instead, just write the product or brand name that
the logo represents.

## Best practices

Use [Atlassian Navigation](/components/atlassian-navigation/examples), which automatically handles
the logo placement and sizing.
