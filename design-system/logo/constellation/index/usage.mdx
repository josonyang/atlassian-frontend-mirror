## Usage

### Color

It's important to be mindful of the context of logos and their usage.

Inside Atlassian apps, our logos work best on surface tokens such as `color.surface` or bold
backgrounds such as `color.background.brand.bold`.

### Types

There are two types of app logos – the lockup and logomark.

#### Lockup

Lockups include both the logomark and app name. These are used in signup and login.

#### Logomark

Logomark doesn’t include the app name. Only use logomarks on their own when the context is very
clear and where possible pair with descriptive text.

## Accessibility

Make sure app or brand name is always included as alternative text when you use a logo lockup or
logomark.

Don’t include the word ‘logo’ in the alternative text. Instead, describe what the logo is for. For
example, if a logo is being used as a link in the header, the alt text could be ‘Go to the Atlassian
home page.’
