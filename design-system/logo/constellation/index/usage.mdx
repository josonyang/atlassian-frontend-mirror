## Usage

To make each Atlassian product logo clear and impactful, we anchored each of them in a core value, benefit, or representation of the product. For example, in Jira Software, we started with a core representation of code – brackets. We worked the shape and style of this symbol, creating a mark that represents teams working in iterative cycles.

### Color

It's important to be mindful of the context of logos and their usage.

Inside our products, Atlassian product logos work best on surface tokens such as `color.surface` or bold backgrounds such as `color.background.brand.bold`.

### Types

There are two types of product logos: the lockup and logomark.

#### Lockup

Lockups include both the logomark and product name. These are used in global navigation, signup, and login.

#### Logomark

Logomark doesn’t include the product name and is used in icon style UI. Use sparingly.

## Accessibility

Make sure product or brand name is always included as alternative text when you use a logomark or logo lockup.

## Best practices

Use [Atlassian Navigation](/components/atlassian-navigation/examples), which automatically handles the logo placement and sizing.
