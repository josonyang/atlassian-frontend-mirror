  [ux] If you view a product in a small window or at higher zoom levels, the sidebar now changes
  sizes to keep all controls in view. In these smaller windows, the sidebar no longer opens on hover
  to avoid accidental opening.

  The sidebar is unchanged in views wider than 768 pixels.

  When viewing a product in a window narrower than 768px or zoomed in at 200%, you'll notice that
  hovering your cursor over the sidebar no longer expands the sidebar.

  To open the sidebar, select the expand sidebar button ( > icon). Select the button again to
  collapse the sidebar. You can also select the edge of the sidebar itself to expand and collapse
  it.

  [`7be6f82bb0d`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7be6f82bb0d) - [ux]
  Behind tested behind a feature flag, we're testing new mobile functionality to keep our left
  sidebar in a "flyout" mode in mobile so navigation or content sits ontop of the main page content
  rather than crushing it.

  This is designed to be SSR-compatible as it's primarily CSS-based with some user-event driven
  logic around mobile breakpoints that should not be inmpacted by SSR rendering (and should return
  the default desktop experience if such a state is achieved).

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- [#34408](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/pull-requests/34408)
  [`4bbc131de00`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/4bbc131de00) - ####
  Fix: Resizing pages with `<iframe>`s

  Pages that contain `<iframe>` elements will now have a smoother resizing experience. `<iframe>`
  elements consume user events (eg `mousemove`) when the user is over the top of them. This is
  problematic for resizing as we need to have the latest user pointer movements to resize the
  sidebar. Now, while a resize is happening, `pointer-events` are blocked on `<iframe>` elements to
  prevent the `<iframe>` consuming user events.

  #### Fix: User cursor while resizing

  While resizing the users cursor will now always be `ew-resize`. Previously the cursor could change
  depending on what element the users pointer was over

  #### Fix: Resizing will no longer change user selection

  A user can select parts of a page (eg select a paragraph of text). Previously, in some cases, a
  user's selection could change due to a resizing operation. This has been fixed so that a resizing
  operation will no longer change a user's selection

  #### Fix: `onResizeEnd`

  `onResizeEnd` will no longer incorrectly get an empty object `{}` if the user resized into the
  collapsed state

  [`2a9f6f800ef`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/2a9f6f800ef) -
  **Fixes**

  - `onLeftSidebarExpand` is no longer called when the sidebar is already open.
    `onLeftSidebarExpand` oculd previously be incorrectly called if a user resized an expanded
    sidebar to slightly smaller than the default sidebar width, or when the user cancelled a sidebar
    resizing operation with the `"Escape"` key
  - the latest provided `onLeftSidebarCollapse` and `onLeftSidebarExpand` functions are now called
    when collapsing / expanding respectively. Previously, only the initial `onLeftSidebarCollapse`
    and `onLeftSidebarExpand` were called (due to a stale closure)
  - `onLeftSidebarCollapse` and `onLeftSidebarExpand` are now called with the latest state values.
    Previously there were only ever called with the initial left sidebar state value (due to a stale
    closure)

  **Improvements**

  - no longer possible to trigger the collapse of the sidebar when it is already collapsed
  - no longer possible to trigger an expand of the sidebar when it is already expanded
  - triggering an expand while the sidebar is collapsing will now flush the pending
    `onLeftSidebarExpand`
  - triggering an collapse while the sidebar is expanding will now flush the pending
    `onLeftSidebarCollapse`
  - only adding the event listener for `"transitionend"` when the sidebar is expanding or
    collapsing.
  - removing `"transitionend"` event listener when `<LeftSidebar />` is unmounted
  - explicitly aborting pending collapse / expand actions when `<LeftSidebar />` is unmounted while
    collapsing / expanding.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [minor][9015d5614a](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/9015d5614a):

  **BREAKING**

  - Make `ResizeControl` composable. If it's not passed as a child to `LeftSidebar`, it will not be
    resizable.

  **NON-BREAKING**

  - Fix a bug with flyout behaviour in non-fixed mode. It no longer pushes body content to the side.
  - Fix a bug where `Main` couldn't handle wide content without breaking the layout.
  - Fixed the bug where expanding the LeftSidebar always set the width to 240px instead of users'
    cached width.
