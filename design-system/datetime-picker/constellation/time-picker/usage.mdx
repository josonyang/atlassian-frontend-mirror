## Usage

Time pickers help users navigate specific times.

Time picker is commonly used in [forms](/patterns/forms).

## Anatomy

1. ** Label: ** Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is left-aligned above the input area.

2. ** Time input field: ** Selecting this field opens the select menu showing available times on the selected date. Once a time is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This example shows time formatted in AM/PM but this can be customized using the `timeFormat` prop.

3. ** Time dropdown: ** Contains the list of all selectable times. This example shows time increments of 30 minutes but can be customized using the `times` prop.

## Content guidelines

- Ensure that locale is appropriately set so that users see times in a familiar format.
- Use a concise label to indicate what the time selection refers to.

## Accessibility

- If using a field with a label other than "Time", use `timePickerSelectProps` to pass the `aria-label` prop. Assistive technologies will announce these along with the label from the field component when activated.
- Allow multiple modes of data entry. Some users prefer entering date and time information by typing instead of selection, especially keyboard users.
- If some dates are disabled, provide accurate validation and error messaging for keyboard users, like: `Please enter a future time`
