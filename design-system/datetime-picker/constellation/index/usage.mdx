## Usage

Date time pickers help users navigate past, present, and future dates as well as specific times.
Users may select a particular date and time via their respective fields.

Date time picker is commonly used in [forms](/patterns/forms).

## Anatomy

1. ** Label: ** Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is
   left-aligned above the input area.

2. ** Date input field: ** Selecting this field opens the calendar component. Users can also input
   dates into the field. Once a date is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This
   example shows date formatted in ‘dd/mm/yyyy’ but this can be customized using the `dateFormat`
   prop.

3. ** Time input field: ** Selecting this field opens the select menu showing available times on the
   selected date. Once a time is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This example
   shows time formatted in AM/PM but this can be customized using the `timeFormat` prop.

4. ** Calendar: ** A menu that contains the list of all dates. Selecting the previous or next arrows
   moves the calendar through months. The selected date area is highlighted by a different color
   fill.

5. ** Time dropdown: ** A menu that contains the list of all selectable times relating to the
   selected date. This example shows time increments of 30 minutes but can be customized using the
   times prop.

## Accessibility

- If using fields with labels other than "Date" and "Time" for the date picker and time picker
  respectively, use the `label` prop within the `datePickerProps` and the `timePickerProps`.
  Assistive technologies will announce these along with the label from the field component when
  activated.
- Allow multiple modes of data entry. Some users prefer entering date and time information by typing
  instead of selection, especially keyboard users.
- If some dates are `disabled`, provide accurate validation and error messaging for keyboard users,
  for example: `Please enter a future date and time`
- Use the `shouldShowCalendarButton` prop from `datePickerProps`. It provides a button for users to
  show the calendar picker popup. This should also be used with both the `openCalendarLabel` and one
  of the following props from the `datePickerProps`: `label`, `inputLabel`, or `inputLabelId`. This
  ensures the calendar button gets a proper accessible name. This will become the standard in the
  future.

## Content guidelines

- Ensure that locale is appropriately set so that users see dates and times in a familiar format.
- Use a concise label to indicate what the date and time selections refer to.
