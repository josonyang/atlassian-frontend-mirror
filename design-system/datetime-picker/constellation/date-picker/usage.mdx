## Usage

Date pickers help users navigate past, present, and future dates.

Date picker is commonly used in [forms](/patterns/forms).

## Anatomy

1. ** Label: ** Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is
   left-aligned above the input area.

2. ** Date input field: ** Selecting this field opens the calendar component. Users can also input
   dates into the field. Once a date is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This
   example shows date formatted in ‘dd/mm/yyyy’ but this can be customized using the `dateFormat`
   prop.

3. ** Calendar: ** Contains the list of all dates. Selecting the previous or next arrows moves the
   calendar through months. The selected date area is highlighted by a different color fill.

## Content guidelines

- Ensure that locale is appropriately set so that users see dates in a familiar format.
- Use a concise label to indicate what the date selection refers to.

## Accessibility

- If using a field with a label other than "Date", use the `label` prop. Assistive technologies will
  announce these along with the label from the field component when activated.
- Allow multiple modes of data entry. Some users prefer entering date and time information by typing
  instead of selection, especially keyboard users.
- If some dates are `disabled`, provide accurate validation and error messaging for keyboard users,
  like: `Please enter a future date`.
