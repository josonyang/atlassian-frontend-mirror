	All examples use the following data model in their tables for easier readability.
</SectionMessage>

```ts
  interface President {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    party: string;
    term: string;
  }

  // applied as rows in the form
  const rows = presidents.map((president: President, index: number) => ({
    key: `row-${index}-${president.name}`,
    cells: [
      {
        key: createKey(president.name),
        content: (
          <NameWrapper>
            <AvatarWrapper>
              <Avatar name={president.name} size="medium" />
            </AvatarWrapper>
            <Link href="https://atlassian.design">{president.name}</Link>
          </NameWrapper>

## Uncontrolled

Dynamic table manages sorting, pagination, loading, and drag and drop state management by default.
If this functionality isn't needed, use
the [native HTML table element](/components/css-reset/examples#tables).

<Example Component={Uncontrolled} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Controlled

In a controlled dynamic table, you need to manage sorting, drag and drop, and pagination on your
own. If you require this functionality, use the stateless dynamic table component.

<Example Component={Controlled} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Sorting

Sorting a dynamic table takes place using the `key` set on each cell. Note that the type of `key`
will affect the sorted result. For example, numeric and string keys will result in different
orderings. Avoid using objects or React nodes as keys.

<Example Component={Sorting} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Loading states

Dynamic table uses a spinner to denote loading state. This is toggled by the `isLoading` prop.

Table content is set to 20% opacity in this loading state, using the `opacity.loading` token.

<Example Component={LoadingStateFewRows} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Empty state

Use the `emptyView` prop to show an empty state in the dynamic table. Empty states communicate that
the table has no content to show. If there's an action that people must take to create or show table
content, add this to the empty state so they know how to proceed. See
[empty state](/components/empty-state/examples) guidelines for more guidance.

<Example Component={EmptyView} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Pagination

You can enable or disable pagination with the `rowsPerPage` prop. If the `rowsPerPage` prop is set
and the number of rows exceed one page, the [pagination](/components/pagination/examples) component
will show below the table.

<Example Component={Pagination} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Drag and drop

Drag and drop functionality is built into the dynamic table. You can enable it using the
`isRankable` prop. This lets people drag rows and rank them in different orders.

<Example Component={PaginationDragAndDrop} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Overflow

Larger tables or tables that cannot be constrained easily can use horizontal scroll. This isn't
supported directly by dynamic table, but the component can be easily extended to support this.

Be mindful that horizontally scrolling tables can cause accessibility issues if there isn't enough
visual affordance to indicate that the table has a scroll. For this reason, we recommend finding
ways to simplify the table before opting for a horizontal scroll solution.

<Example Component={Overflow} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Custom column span

Individual cells can use `colSpan` to make cells span across more than one column.

<Example Component={ColSpan} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Highlighted row

You can highlight rows with `highlightedRowIndex`. Highlights provide additional visual prominence
to a row. For example, you could use highlighted rows to show new rows that are added to a table.

Keep in mind that people with visual disabilities may not notice when rows are highlighted, so don’t
rely on highlights alone to convey information. Never use highlighted rows to indicate that a person
has selected or focused on the row.

<Example Component={HighlightedRow} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Interactive row

Rows can be interactive if you provide an `onClick` or `onKeydown` handler to the row.

<Example Component={InteractiveRow} packageName="@atlaskit/dynamic-table" />

## Focus after row deletion

When a table row is deleted, focus should move to the next focusable item in the table.

If the deletion of the row is confirmed from a modal, focus should move from the modal to the next
focusable item after the original trigger.

If you remove an element from the DOM and don't set the focus, it returns to the body element at the
top of the page. And for people using assistive technology, this means they'll need to navigate
through the entire page to return to where they originally were, which we don’t want.
