## Props

<SectionMessage>
  <p>
    <Snippet>@atlaskit/popper</Snippet> extends the render props functionality of react-popper@2.2.5.
    To view the full set of available props for each component, please refer to the{' '}
    <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/render-props/" target="_blank">react-popper
      documentation</a>.
  </p>
</SectionMessage>

Popper has three main exports, which are all necessary to configure the popper:

```tsx
import { Manager, Reference, Popper  } from '@atlaskit/popper';
```

### Manager

Manager must be wrapped around both the Popper and Reference. It does not require any props.

### Reference

This component wraps your reference element â€“ that is, the element that your popper should be
'attached' to. It passes a `ref` render prop to its child, which should be attached to the dom
element you want the popper to be attached to.

```tsx
<Reference>
  {({ ref }) => (
    <button ref={ref}>
      Reference element
    </button>
  )}
</Reference>
````

### Popper

This component wraps your popper element, which will be positioned around the
reference element. It passes a few render props to its child, in particular a `ref` prop
which should be attached to the DOM element that you want to position, and a `style` prop
which supplies the necessary styles to position the DOM element. For more information on the
render props, check [the react-popper docs](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/render-props/).

```tsx
<Popper>
  {({ ref, style }) => (
    <div ref={ref} style={style}>
      This text is an example of the pop-up content
    </div>
  )}
</Popper>
```

#### Standard behaviors

Poppers will try to flip to stay in the document/window boundaries (plus
padding), and shift along the reference boundary until the reference is
off-screen. You can customise this behavior using custom modifiers.

#### Scroll Container

By default, Poppers won't flip or shift when over the edge of a scroll container, however you can use
the `isReferenceHidden` render prop to conditionally add styles to hide them.

#### Modifiers

Popper JS is extensible with a number of different modifiers, which hook into the lifecycle
of Popper and apply different behaviors such as positioning, overflow and hiding the popper.
Many of the core features that make Popper JS useful are implemented as modifiers, and `@atlaskit/popper`
applies several of these by default. You can find out more about modifiers in the
[Popper JS docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/).

The default behaviors we enable for `@atlaskit/popper` are listed below. To overwrite these behaviors pass
an array of replacement modifiers using the **`modifiers`** prop.

##### flip

[View the flip docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/flip/).

The *flip* modifier changes the placement of a popper if it's about to overflow a specific boundary.
`@atlaskit/popper` enables this by default with some padding included.

By default, Popper JS allows poppers to flip on multiple axes, which is disabled via `flipVariations`
to allow the popper to 'slide' along the edge of the reference component as the reference leaves.

`@atlaskit/popper` sets the boundary where the popper flips to the viewport, rather than the document.

```tsx
{
  name: 'flip',
  options: {
    flipVariations: false,
    padding: 5,
    boundary: 'clippingParents',
    rootBoundary: 'viewport',
  },
}
```

##### preventOverflow

[View the preventOverflow docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/prevent-overflow/).

The *prevent overflow* modifier prevents the popper from being cut off by moving it so that it stays visible within its boundary area.

```tsx
{
  name: 'preventOverflow',
  options: {
    padding: 5,
    rootBoundary: 'document',
  },
},
```

##### hide

[View the hide docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/hide/).

Sets a render prop `isReferenceHidden` when the reference element is hidden (i.e. leaves the viewport
or the edges of the scroll container), and `hasPopperEscaped` when the popper becomes detached from
its reference. This behavior is enabled by default in `react-popper` and has no additional config in
`@atlaskit/popper`.

##### offset

[View the offset docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/offset/).

Allows for the popper to be offset by a customisable amount in the x or y direction. The first value
is the offset *along* the edge of the reference, while the second is the distance *away* from the
reference. This is set to the value provided in `@atlaskit/popper`'s offset prop, and defaults to
0px offset along, and 8px offset away ([0, 8])

```tsx
{
  name: 'offset',
  options: {
    offset: [0, 8]
  },
}
```

##### preventOverflow

[View the preventOverflow docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/prevent-overflow/).

Moves the popper along the edge of the reference so that its contents aren't outside the viewport boundary.
Padding changes the distance from the edge of the viewport at which the popper starts to move.

```tsx
{
  name: 'preventOverflow',
  options: {
    padding: 5,
    rootBoundary: 'document',
  },
}
```
