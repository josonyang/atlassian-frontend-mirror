## Default

All flags require a `title` and an `icon`. Make sure the icon and color match the intent of your message, such as warning, error, information, or success. A dismiss button will auto-display on the first flag in a `FlagGroup` or when the `appearance` prop is set.

Flags are often used within a [flag group](./flag-group/examples).

<Example Component={FlagDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

## Actions

Use `actions` to show a clickable action at the bottom of the flag. For flags where the appearance is `normal`, the action will show as a link. For all other appearances the actions will be buttons.

<Example Component={FlagActions} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

## Appearance

Unlike normal flags, setting an `appearance` gives the flag a bold color. Bold appearance flags don't have a dismiss button, so they require a more direct interaction from people.

### Information

Information messages alert people to additional information without requiring an action. You can also use them for loading states.

<Example Component={FlagInfo} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

### Warning

Warning messages appear before we request people to take action. This is usually in anticipation of a significant change.

Never set warning flags to auto dismiss. Give people enough time to read your message and decide what to do.

<Example Component={FlagWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

### Error

Error messages let people know that something has gone wrong after they've tried to do something or if there are connectivity issues.

Never set error flags to auto dismiss. Give people enough time to read your message and understand the problem.

<Example Component={FlagError} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

### Success

Success messages let people know they have completed an action.

<Example Component={FlagSuccess} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />
