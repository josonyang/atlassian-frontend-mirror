## Default

Use `AutoDismissFlag` to create a flag that will be dismissed automatically in eight seconds.

<Example Component={AutoDismissFlagDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

## Appearance

You can style the auto dismiss flag with any of the `appearance` props.

However, we recommend only creating auto dismissing flags that use the `info` or `success` appearance and messaging. Don't create `warning` or `error` flags that auto dismiss, as people may miss their important notification.

### Information

Use `appearance="info"` to alert people to additional information without requiring an action. These are also used for loading states.

<Example Component={AutoDismissFlagInfo} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

### Success

Use `appearance="success"` to let people know that they have completed an action. Reaffirm the outcome and let the user continue.

<Example Component={AutoDismissFlagSuccess} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />

## Actions

Use `actions` to show a clickable action at the bottom of the flag. For flags where the `appearance` is `normal`, the action will be shown as a link. For all other appearances the action will be shown as a button.

Be mindful that many people won't be able to read and decide to select a link within the eight seconds that an auto dismiss flag is available to them. If it's important that people can select the link, use a regular [flag](/components/flag/examples) instead.

<Example Component={AutoDismissFlagActions} packageName="@atlaskit/flag" />
