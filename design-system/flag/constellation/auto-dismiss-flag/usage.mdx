## Usage

Flags appear at the bottom left of the screen and overlay any content. Use the auto dismiss flag component for flags that appear only temporarily.

## Accessibility

Keep in mind that some people require more time to read and make decisions about your message. Never use auto dismiss flags for any critical warning or error messages, or anything else where it's important that people don't miss the message.
