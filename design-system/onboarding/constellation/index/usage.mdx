## Usage

An onboarding spotlight focuses attention on a specific part of the UI, like a button or an icon.
Spotlights can also guide people through tasks that require multiple steps to complete. Only show
one spotlight at a time.

## Anatomy

1. **Spotlight target:** The section of the UI that you want to call attention to. It can be
   rectangular or circular. Typically this surrounds an isolated element like an icon, button, or
   text field.
1. **Message:** Try to restrict messages to two lines in length. Showcase a single change and how it
   benefits the person reading your message. Try to avoid just naming the function.
1. **Action:** In a multi-step tour, these will be the skip and next buttons. In spotlights where
   you want people to try an action, the button should lead to that new action.
1. **Pulse:** A pulse animation to draw attention to the spotlight target.
1. **Blanket:** A translucent overlay that covers the rest of the screen that is not being spotlit.
<!-- This is only necessary for multi-step spotlight tours. -->

## Behavior

### Pulse

The spotlight target can have a pulse animation to draw attention to the focused area.

## Best practices

- For spotlight tours, keep the entire flow in mind. Sequence tasks and messages in a logical way to
  increase success.
- Offer a dismiss option at every step. Don't force people to participate.
- Ideally, spotlights should only have a single step. Don't overwhelm people with too much
  information. Try and combine or eliminate tasks where possible. Aim for 3-4 steps maximum. People
  only need enough information to get them started.
- Make sure your spotlight isn’t competing with other onboarding messages from other teams. Not
  every change requires changeboarding, so ask yourself if this message is really necessary or
  helpful.

## Content guidelines

### Headings

- Use the heading to communicate the main benefit to the user. For example, "Manage your issues"
  instead of "Issue types".
- Write headings in sentence case.
- Limit headings to just a few words. Personalize where you can, for example, “Your room”.

### Message copy

- Include the benefits of the feature and why it's important to the person seeing it.
- Keep the text length to two lines at the product's minimum supported size.
- Be considerate of peoples time and patience. Short bursts of information are better. Don't repeat
  content from the title, and put the most important keywords at the start of the sentence.
- If you talk about an element or a location within the body of the spotlight message, that element
  should be visible on the screen at the same time. Don't talk about things that the viewer can't
  see.
- Avoid having people look in another location for more information, but if it can't be avoided, use
  a link to support documentation.

### Call to action (CTA)

- For buttons leading people through the steppers of a spotlight, use "Next".
- An option to dismiss or cancel reassures people that they can opt out.
- For the last in a series of steps, or for any action which confirms or closes a spotlight message,
  use "OK".
