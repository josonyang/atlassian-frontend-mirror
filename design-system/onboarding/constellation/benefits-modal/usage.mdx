## Usage

A benefits modal focuses a person's attention on a large or impactful update (for information on how to size first impressions, see [user journey sizes](/patterns/first-impressions/user-journey-sizes/)).

The modal can be followed by a [spotlight tour](/components/onboarding/usage) to highlight changes and benefits at the right time and place.

## Anatomy

![The example benefits modal has an illustration of tiny people reaching for a giant wrapped present. The title is "Experience the new Jira". The message that follows is "Check out our restructured interface and a bold, colorful design that reflects the vibrance of your team. Try it out early and get a chance to influence how we build the next generation of Atlassian". The two buttons are "Remind me later" and "Get started".](images/benefits-modal-anatomy.png)

The benefits modal component is made up of the following:

- **Illustration:** Should relate to the content or benefit literally or metaphorically.
- **Title:** A primary heading (h600). The title provides a concise overview of the contents of the journey.
- **Message:** The contents of the dialog. See content guidelines below.
- **Actions:** Contains a maximum of two centered buttons: a primary action and a dismiss button.
  <!-- The main action should be self-describing action verbs ('Get started' instead of 'OK'). -->
  <!-- The above guidance seems to conflict with other guidance we have... maybe its OK since this is for the modal and not spotlight? -->
- **Blanket:** Covers the content underneath the modal, so that the focus is on the modal, and people can't accidentally interact with the background content.

## Accessibility

### Use custom modal dialogs where possible

We recommend using a [custom modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog/examples#custom-modal) instead of this component for all new experiences. This is because modal dialog has `shouldCloseOnEscapeKeyPress` and `shouldCloseOnOverlayClick` behavior which significantly improves the accessibility.

### Write clear onboarding messages

Avoid jargon and use simple language. Write button text that clearly explains what will happen next in the flow.

### Use images sparingly

If the illustration provides useful information, include alternative text. If it's only for decoration, use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) to save time for people using assistive technology.

Using an image as a metaphor may not translate to all cultures and languages. When choosing imagery, consider internationalization.

## Best practices

- Make sure onboarding messages complement rather than compete with each other. Try using the entire end-to-end journey that your new experience is a part of. This can help you discover where you may be repetitive or where steps may not be needed. Less is more.
- Try not to overwhelm people with too much information at once. Focus on the top two to three benefits and then gradually introduce changes over time.
- Offer a dismiss option at every point in the journey.
- Ask yourself if a modal is the right medium for this message - modals are intrusive and should only be used for large-scale changes.
- Illustrations should be a spot hero image that relates to the UI copy.

## Content guidelines

### Titles

- Use the title to communicate the main benefit in an active and personalized way, for example: "Manage your issues", instead of "Issue types."
- Personalize where you can, for example: "A better experience for your team", instead of "Better team experiences."
- Limit titles to three words. Four words are okay if you are using a short article like “an”, “a”, or “the”.

### Message copy

- Keep the message length to less than three lines at the product's minimum supported size.
- Don't just point out what the feature or functionality is. Tell people why it's important at this point in time.
- Be considerate of people's time and patience. Be short and to the point, and avoid using company jargon.
