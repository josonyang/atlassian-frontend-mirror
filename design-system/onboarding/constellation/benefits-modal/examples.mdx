## Basic

You can use a benefits modal to explain large or impactful updates. While `children` is the only
required prop, all benefits modals should include a heading and actions.

Include an illustration with all benefits modals. If you feel that the story isn't strong enough to
require one, use a [spotlight](/components/onboarding/examples) instead.

We recommend using a [custom modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog/examples#custom-modal) instead
of this component for all new experiences. This is because modal dialog has
`shouldCloseOnEscapeKeyPress` and `shouldCloseOnOverlayClick` behavior which significantly improves
the accessibility.
