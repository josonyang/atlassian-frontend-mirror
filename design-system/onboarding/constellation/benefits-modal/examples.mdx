<SectionMessage appearance="warning" title="Use with caution">
	We recommend using our modal dialog component instead of this component for all new experiences.
	This is because modal dialog has a native close button and better default close behaviors, which
	all significantly improve the accessibility and experience for all users.

You can use a benefits modal to explain large or impactful updates. All benefits modals should
include a heading and actions.

Include an illustration with all benefits modals. If you feel that the story isn't strong enough to
require one, use a [spotlight](/components/onboarding/examples) instead.
