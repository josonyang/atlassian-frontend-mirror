## Usage

You can customise the spotlight card to highlight product features in different contexts.

## Anatomy

![Examples of five spotlight cards with individual parts labeled. The description of each individual part follows this image.](images/spotlight-card-anatomy.png)

1. **Stepper:** Step through a series of cards to communicate multiple benefits of a single element
   or related task. Avoid using this to show the actual steps of a task, and always use as few steps
   as possible.
2. **Secondary button:** Include a primary and secondary action. Best practice is to always allow
   people to dismiss the spotlight.
3. **Spotlight area action:** Include a call to action to help the person interact with the spotlit
   feature.
4. **Illustration:** Include an illustration if it enhances understanding for people, and doesn't
   distract. Illustrations should relate to the spotlight content or benefit.
5. **Heading:** Include a heading to draw attention to the message. Keep your UI copy focused on the
   task that it helps people complete.

## Accessibility

- If you use an illustration that provides useful information, include alternative text. If it's
  only for decoration, avoid alt text, or consider removing the image altogether.
