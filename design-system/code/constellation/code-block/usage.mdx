## Usage

Use a code block to display preformatted blocks of code snippets that are longer than a line or a
single expression. For example, to display functions or entire files.

You can call attention to specific lines of code using
[line highlighting](/code-block/examples#line-highlighting).

## Anatomy

1. **Code snippet:** The code snippet is a block of monospaced text used to display lines of code.
2. **Line numbers (optional):** If enabled, line numbers show to the left of the code snippet.

## Accessibility

When overriding default styles, make sure that all text has a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. For
more information, see our [color guidelines](/foundations/color-new/).
