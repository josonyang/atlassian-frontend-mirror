## `<FadeIn />`

Useful for fading in one or more elements.

<TSMorphProps exportName="FadeIn" packageName="@atlaskit/motion" />

## `<SlideIn />`

Will slide an element into position, generally used for things that appear from outside of the viewport into view.

<TSMorphProps exportName="SlideIn" packageName="@atlaskit/motion" />

## `<ZoomIn />`

Will over zoom an element into position.

<TSMorphProps exportName="ZoomIn" packageName="@atlaskit/motion" />

## `<ShrinkOut />`

<SectionMessage appearance="warning">
  This motion only has an exiting motion. StaggeredEntrance will have no effect.
</SectionMessage>

Will shrink an element down to nothing when exiting.
Works best with flex children as collapsing margins can come with undesired behavior.

<TSMorphProps exportName="ShrinkOut" packageName="@atlaskit/motion" />

## `<StaggeredEntrance />`

Useful for staggering an entering motion over many elements.

<TSMorphProps exportName="StaggeredEntrance" packageName="@atlaskit/motion" />

## `<ExitingPersistence />`

Useful for enabling elements to persist and animate away when they are removed from the DOM.

<TSMorphProps exportName="ExitingPersistence" packageName="@atlaskit/motion" />
