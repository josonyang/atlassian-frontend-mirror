## Duration

There are three durations available, each size increases in duration.
Use a larger duration for an element that moves a large distance, or is a large element.

```
import {
  durationStep,
  smallDurationMs,
  mediumDurationMs,
  largeDurationMs,
} from '@atlaskit/motion';
```

All durations are multiples of `durationStep`. Do the current durations not fit your purpose?
No worries! Make sure to create a custom one from `durationStep`.

### Duration decision matrix

Use this table if you're unsure what duration you should use.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th>Small element</th>
      <th>Large element</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Short distance</strong></th>
      <td><code>smallDurationMs</code></td>
      <td><code>mediumDurationMs</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Long distance</strong></th>
      <td><code>mediumDurationMs</code></td>
      <td><code>largeDurationMs</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Curves

There are three curves available, each used for a particular user interaction, or how the element appears.

```
import { easeInOut, easeIn, easeOut } from '@atlaskit/motion';
```

### Curves decision matrix

Use this table if you're unsure what curve you should use.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
      <td></td>
      <th><code>easeInOut</code></th>
      <th><code>easeOut</code></th>
      <th><code>easeIn</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
      <th scope="row"><i>When to use</i></th>
      <td>When an element has been interacted with indirectly.</td>
      <td>When an element has been interacted with directly. <br/>When an element appears from off screen.</td>
      <td>Use rarely. Only used if an element is moving indirectly entirely off the screen.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
      <th scope="row"><i>Example use case</i></th>
      <td>A user clicks a button, and a separate element moves.</td>
      <td>A user clicks an element, and that same element moves. <br/>A drawer appears from off screen.</td>
      <td>A user clicks a button which spins and waits. After the operation is finished the button enters a confirmed state and the modal slides entirely off the screen.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
