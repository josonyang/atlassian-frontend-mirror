## Prefers reduced motion

Motion comes with reduced motion support.

[Reduced motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) enables users to tell websites they don't want to see animations.

### Is reduced motion (outside React)

Use the `isReducedMotion()` function when performing motion at runtime and outside the context of a React render.

```
import { isReducedMotion } from '@atlaskit/motion';

const onClick = () => {
  if (!isReducedMotion()) {
    // do the motion
  }
}
```

### Use reduced motion (React)

Use the `useReducedMotion()` hook when performing motion at runtime and in the context of a React render.

Using a hook is preferable to calling `isReducedMotion()` here, as the hook can re-render your component if the user's motion preference changes at runtime.
This means they don't need to refresh the page for their change to take effect.

```
import { useIsReducedMotion } from '@atlaskit/motion';

const FancyChart = (props) => {
  const isReducedMotion = useIsReducedMotion();
  return <ThirdPartyChartingLibrary data={props.data} animate={!isReducedMotion} />;
}
```

### Prefers reduced motion (CSS)

Useful when performing motion with just CSS.

```
import { reduceMotionAsPerUserPreference } from '@atlaskit/motion';

// css prop
<div
  css={css({
    animationName: 'slide-in',
    ...reduceMotionAsPerUserPreference
  })}
/>

// styled components
styled.div({
  animationName: 'slide-in',
  ...reduceMotionAsPerUserPreference
});
```
