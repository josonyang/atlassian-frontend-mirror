This hook will animate `height` changes over state changes. If the height hasn't changed nothing will happen.

<PropsTable heading="" props={ResizingHeightOpts} />

### Optimizations

Every state update (and thus a new render) will cause this hook to check if the `height` has changed via [`getBoundingClientRect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect).
Because of that you'll probably want to make sure renders only happen if your props actually change.
Remember to **measure first and optimize second**.

If you see this slowing things down make sure to utilise either [`React.memo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) or [`PureComponent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent),
**try placing it as high in the tree** as makes sense.
If you have too many `React.memo` or `PureComponent`'s you could get worse performance.

```
import React, { memo } from 'react';
import { useResizingHeight } from '@atlaskit/motion';

export default memo(({ title }) => (
  <div {...useResizingHeight()}>
    {title}
  </div>
));
```

## <ResizingHeight />

Component which consumes the [useResizingHeight](/components/motion/resizing-motions/code#useresizingheight) under-the-hood.
Its props are the same as the hooks options.

```
import { ResizingHeight } from '@atlaskit/motion';

<ResizingHeight>
  {props => <div {...props} />}
</ResizingHeight>
```
