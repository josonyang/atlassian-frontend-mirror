## Usage

Use an avatar group when you want to display a collection of avatars. You can also use them for easy
collapse states for a set number of avatars, and with a dropdown to show hidden avatars.

## Behavior

### Stack

1. **Avatar group:** Stacked groups are limited to five avatars, and should only be used with medium
   or small avatars.
2. **Truncated:** For groups larger than six, five avatars are displayed. Additional avatars are
   represented as an avatar with the text +N (where N is the remaining number of avatars above
   five).
3. **States:** The avatar state will change when a person interacts with it, for example: displaying
   a tooltip on hover.
4. **Dropdown menu:** When hovering over the truncated avatar, a dropdown menu shows the truncated
   user names.

### Grid

1. **Avatar group:** Grids are limited to three rows.
2. **Truncated:** For groups larger than 12, 11 avatars are displayed. Additional avatars are
   represented as an avatar with the text +N (where N is the remaining number of avatars above 11).
3. **States:** The avatar state will change when a person interacts with it, for example: displaying
   a tooltip on hover.
4. **List menu:** All of the avatars are displayed in a list when a person selects the truncated
   avatar.

## Accessibility

- As the avatar is a visual representation of a person or entity, make sure thereâ€™s an alt text
  equivalent included for screen readers for users, projects, spaces, groups, and repositories.
- Use the `label` prop to describe the list's entity type, for example: if the label is
  `team members` for a group of five avatars, the screen reader announcement would be "list team
  members, five items".
- When there is more than one avatar group on the page, make sure to differentiate each group with a
  unique label.
