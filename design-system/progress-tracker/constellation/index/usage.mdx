## Usage

Use a progress tracker to guide people through steps or actions across multiple screens, in order to
complete a task. The progress tracker must have three or more steps.

The tracker shows people what stage they are in a process. They can navigate through the process by
selecting one of the steps.

## Anatomy

![The example progress tracker is a 4-step horizontal bar, with the labels "Welcome", "Create a space", "Upload photo" and "Your details".](images/progress-tracker-anatomy.png)

1. **Progress bar:** A filled horizontal bar that shows people their progress and the number of
   steps required to complete the task.
2. **Current step:** The current step in the progress aligns with the color fill and has colored
   text.
3. **Unvisited:** Shows steps that haven't been visited yet. The step and label are more subtle to
   indicate this.
4. **Visited:** Steps that have already been visited are higher contrast and have clickable links,
   so that people can navigate back to them.
5. **Disabled:** A grayed-out label indicates a step that people can't revisit.

## Best practices

- If a task needs more than six steps, consider simplifying the process or breaking it up into
  multiple tasks
- If there are less than three steps, consider using a button labelled "Next"

## Content guidelines

Use labels that clearly indicate the purpose of the step. When writing, keep options to a single
line of text, be short and concise (1-2 words), and follow the
[writing guidelines](/content/writing-style).

When labeling each step, identify the general theme of each step so that if details in the process
change, the label still makes sense.

For example, in a checkout process people may or may not need to enter their shipping details,
depending on whether the purchase is of a digital item or a physical item, but must always enter
payment details. Calling this step "Your details‚Äù allows it to either be connected to the payment
and shipping details screen, or just the payment screen.
