## Usage

Use icon-only buttons when space is limited and the icon has a clear meaning.

There are very few icons that have clear and common associations across products, so use buttons with text labels where space allows or when the action is very important.

1. **Button:** Can be square or round, depending on the context.
2. **Icon:** An existing [system icon](/components/icon).
3. **Tooltip label:** All icon buttons require a clear text label for tooltips and screen readers.

### Use icons with clear meanings, or else use a button with a text label

To test whether an icon button will be clear, apply the five-second rule: if it takes you more than five seconds to think of an appropriate icon, it is unlikely that an icon can effectively communicate that action.

If the icon isn’t commonly used or has multiple different associations, use a [button with a text label](/components/button/examples) instead.

### Choose an existing system icon with a clear meaning

Don’t use icon-only buttons with custom icons. If you are creating a new icon, it’s probably a more complex idea that would require a [button with a text label](/components/button/examples).

## Accessibility

<!-- TODO get accessibility review and check this against other a11y button guidance for consistency -->

- Clearly describe the icon button action in a tooltip and label for screen readers. Follow the [button label content guidance for clear and active labels](/components/button/icon-button/usage#content-guidelines).
- Consider localization: does the icon have a clear single meaning that holds up for everyone, including people from different cultures or places?
- Avoid disabling buttons and follow all [general button accessibility guidance](/components/button/usage#accessibility).

## Best practices

- Follow our iconography guidance and use the line versions of icons for most cases. You can use filled icons to show an action has been taken or selected.

## Content guidelines

Use sentence case for all button action tooltips and labels, unless there’s a proper noun in the button. This creates consistency for assistive technologies.

Where possible, specify the object being acted on in the tooltip label. For example “Edit page” instead of just “Edit”.
