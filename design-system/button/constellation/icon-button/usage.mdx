## Usage

Use icon-only buttons when space is limited and the icon has a clear association with the action.

1. **Button:** Can be square or round, depending on the context.
2. **Icon:** An existing [system icon](/components/icon).
3. **Tooltip:** All icon buttons require a clear name for tooltips (and screen readers).

### Choose an existing system icon

Don’t use icon-only buttons with custom icons. If you are creating a new icon, it’s probably a more complex idea that would require a [button with a text label](/components/button/examples).

Use an existing [system icon](/components/icon/) instead.

### Use icons with clear meanings, or else use a button with a text label

There are very few icons that have clear and common associations across products, so use [buttons with text labels](/components/button/usage) where space allows or when the action is very important.

Also consider localization when using icons. Does the icon have a clear meaning that holds up for everyone, including people from different cultures or places?

To test whether an icon button will be clear, apply the five-second rule: if it takes you more than five seconds to think of an appropriate icon, it is unlikely that an icon can effectively communicate that action.

  Use an icons with a well-established association to an action in Atlassian and
  other software products.
</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">
  Don't use one icon to mean many different things, and don't use icons that
  aren't clear and obvious to most people.
</DoDont>

## Accessibility

### Always include a clear, accessible name as an aria label

Clearly describe the icon button action in an aria label for screen readers. Follow the [button label content guidance for clear and active labels](/components/button/icon-button/usage#content-guidelines).

### Avoid disabling buttons

Avoid disabling buttons and follow all [general button accessibility guidance](/components/button/usage#accessibility).

## Best practices

### Use line versions of icons for most buttons

Follow our [iconography guidance](/foundations/iconography/) and use the line versions of icons for most cases. You can use filled icons to show an action has been taken or selected.

## Content guidelines

### Use sentence casing for labels

Use sentence case for all button tooltips and aria labels. This creates consistency for assistive technologies.

Only capitalize the first letter of the button label and any proper nouns. Most feature names aren’t capitalized or considered proper nouns when following [our capitalization guidance](/content/language-and-grammar#capitalization).

### Use specific labels wherever possible

Where possible, specify the object being acted on in the tooltip and aria label. For example “Edit page” instead of just “Edit”.
