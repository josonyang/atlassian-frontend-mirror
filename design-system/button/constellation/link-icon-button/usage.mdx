## Usage

Link icon buttons open new pages, websites, or new locations on a page. These are buttons that
behave like links. For actions that only affect the current page, use a regular
[icon button](/components/button/icon-button/).

1. **Button:** Most icon buttons should be square, aside from some select round icons that appear in
   the top navigation.
2. **Icon:** An existing [system icon](/components/icon).
3. **Tooltip:** All icon buttons require a clear name for tooltips (and screen readers).

### Use link icon buttons for navigation or other URL-change actions

If you need an icon button that changes the page location, opens an email client, or otherwise links
to somewhere, consider whether you could use a link in your design instead:

- Buttons are typically for on-page actions, such as opening a modal.
- Links are for changing locations or page URLs in some way.

If a button is better suited to your design, use a link icon button. This ensures people using
assistive technologies can interact with the link as expected.

### Choose an existing system icon

Don’t use icon-only buttons with custom icons. If you are creating a new icon, it’s probably a more
complex idea that would require a
[link button with a text label](/components/button/link-button/examples).

Use an existing [system icon](/components/icon/) instead.

### Use icons with clear meanings, or else use a button with a text label

There are very few icons that have clear and common associations across apps, so use
[link buttons with text labels](/components/button/link-button) where space allows or when the
action is very important.

Also consider localization when using icons. Does the icon have a clear meaning that holds up for
everyone, including people from different cultures or places?

To test whether an icon button will be clear, apply the five-second rule: if it takes you more than
five seconds to think of an appropriate icon, it is unlikely that an icon can effectively
communicate that action.

>
	Use an icons with a well-established association to an action in Atlassian and other software
	products.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: IconButtonDont,
		alt: 'A group of icon buttons which use icons that are ambiguous and have no well-established association to an action in Atlassian and other software products.',
	}}
>
	Don't use one icon to mean many different things, and don't use icons that aren't clear and
	obvious to most people.
</DoDont>

## Accessibility

### Always include a clear, accessible name as a label

Clearly describe the icon button action in a
[label](/components/button/link-icon-button/code#CommonProps-label) for screen readers. Follow the
[button label content guidance for clear and active labels](/components/button/usage#content-guidelines).
The provided label will be rendered as visually hidden content in the button, rather than using
aria-label which is not always translated into other languages by translation services.

### Avoid disabling buttons

Avoid disabling buttons and follow all
[general button accessibility guidance](/components/button/usage#accessibility).

## Best practices

### Use line versions of icons for most buttons

Follow our [iconography guidance](/foundations/iconography/) and use the line versions of icons for
most cases. You can use filled icons to show an action has been taken or selected.

## Content guidelines

### Use sentence casing for labels

Use sentence case for all button tooltips and labels. This creates consistency for assistive
technologies.

Only capitalize the first letter of the button label and any proper nouns. Most feature names aren’t
capitalized or considered proper nouns when following
[our capitalization guidance](/content/language-and-grammar#capitalization).

### Use specific labels wherever possible

Where possible, specify the object being acted on in the tooltip and label. For example “Edit page”
instead of just “Edit”.
