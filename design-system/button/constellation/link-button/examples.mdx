## Default

A button that triggers a link rather than an action. This will render an `<a>` tag instead of a
`<button>`. It accepts anchor tag HTML attributes, including `href`.

The default appearance is for secondary actions or general actions that aren't the most important in
the area.

<Example Component={LinkButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Routing

Link button consumes the router link component configured in the
[app provider](/components/app-provider/examples#router-links) when possible. This means router
links are configured once across an application (replacing
[the component prop](/components/button/button-legacy/examples#routing)).

External links, non-HTTP-based links (`mailto:`, `sms:`), and anchor or hash links (`#`) **won't**
use the configured router link when passed to `href`. These render a standard `<a>` tag.

### Advanced href usage with TypeScript

Link button accepts a generic type containing the configured router link's props. This is only for
advanced usage to pass an object to `href`.

<Example
	Component={LinkButtonWithRouting}
	packageName="@atlaskit/button"
	appearance="source-only"
/>

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a primary link button when the main call to action is to navigate to a new page or URL.

<Example Component={LinkButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use subtle buttons when the surrounding context makes it clear the text is interactive, like in
navigation areas.

<Example Component={LinkButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

Warning appearances are designed to confirm someone wants to proceed despite a potentially
unintended or inconvenient (but reversible) outcome. In general, try to avoid these unclear outcomes
in the first place.

<Example Component={LinkButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

Danger appearances are similar to warnings, but these should be reserved for situations with severe
consequences, such as a permanent loss of data or an action that affects many users.

<Example Component={LinkButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Icon

Buttons can include an icon before or after the text label. Only use icons if it is necessary to aid
comprehension. Most of the time, a text label alone is clearer.

For buttons that open a link in a new tab or external website, use a link button with an icon after
the text.

<Example Component={LinkButtonIcon} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## States

### Disabled

Standard buttons use the `disabled` HTML attribute, however this doesn't exist for anchor `<a>`
tags, so link buttons are disabled by removing the `href` attribute and adding
`aria-disabled="true"` and `role="link"`.

<Example Component={LinkButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />
