## Default

Use default buttons for most actions that aren't the main call to action for a page or container. Default buttons are less visually prominent than primary buttons.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a primary button to call attention to a [form](/patterns/forms) submission or to highlight the most important call to action on a page.
Primary buttons should only appear once per container (not including the application header or in a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog)). Not every screen requires a primary button.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use a `subtle` button with a primary button for secondary actions, such as â€œCancel".

<Example Component={LegacyButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Link

Use a `link` button to navigate to another page. These should open in the same window unless information may be lost (for example, when someone is filling out a form), or when the destination is an external site (for example, a knowledge base article).

<Example Component={LegacyButtonLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle link

Similar to a `subtle` button, but looks like a `link` button. Use a `subtle link` button to avoid overwhelming the page with blue links.

Make sure your designs have clear affordances for interactable areas and elements.

Because there is no color affordance, this style of button relies on the context around it to show that it can be interacted with.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonSubtleLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

Warning buttons often confirm actions that might cause a significant change or a loss of data.
Typically, the warning appearance alerts people of a problem that might happen if they proceed.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

The `danger` button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive and irreversible action, such as deleting.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## States

### Disabled

Disabled buttons can cause accessibility issues (disabled elements are not in the tab order) so wherever possible, avoid using `isDisabled`.
Instead, use validation or other techniques to show what's needed to proceed.

Never disable a form submission button.

Never put a tooltip on a disabled button. For more information see our [usage guidelines](/components/button/usage#do-not-put-tooltips-on-disabled-buttons).

<Example Component={LegacyButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonSelected} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Loading

Set `isLoading` to indicate the button is loading. The button text is hidden and a spinner is shown in its place, while maintaining the width that it would have if the text were visible.

To assist screen readers, it will also set the `aria-busy` attribute based on the value of `isLoading`. For this reason, it's important that elements containing `LoadingButton`'s have an `aria-live` attribute (e.g. `aria-live="polite"`).

<Example Component={LegacyButtonLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Spacing

Buttons can have various spacing. Default spacing is used for most use cases, compact for tables and none for breadcrumbs.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonPadding} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Full width

Buttons can expand to full width to fill the parent container.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Button with icon

### Icon before

Button with an icon before the text.

<Example
  Component={LegacyButtonWithIconBefore}
  packageName="@atlaskit/button"
/>

### Icon after

Button with an icon after the text.

<Example Component={LegacyButtonWithIconAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Routing

Button's `component` prop allows a custom React component or HTML element to render
in place of a `<button>` or `<a>` element.

This is useful for using Button with the `<Link>` component from popular routing libraries.

```js
import Link from '@popular/routing-library';
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';

// Set a custom component
<PrimaryButton component={Link}>Your Work</PrimaryButton>;
```

## Custom theme button (not recommended)

Avoid using this component. It will be deprecated when our alternative, safer theming solution is ready.
Latest versions of button use design tokens. These have theming and dark mode support built in.

Custom theme button is only for people already using custom theming to refer to, which is hard to use and has performance issues.

```js
import { CustomThemeButton } from '@atlaskit/button';
```
