## Usage

Split buttons can simplify a UI with multiple similar actions when there’s a clear default action that will work for most people.

The parts of a split button:

1. **Main action button:** The default action that most users will take.
2. **Main action label:** Make sure button labels follow the [button content guidelines](/components/button/split-button/usage#content-guidelines).
3. **Dropdown menu icon button:** A dropdown icon button attached to the main action button, separated by a visual divider. This opens the menu of related actions. Requires a label for accessibility.
4. **Seconary actions:** A menu of actions that are parallel or similar to the main action.

<!-- Should we add an item for the secondary action label / tooltip? maybe as an annotation if it isn't a tooltip? -->

### Use split buttons for directly related actions with one clear default

The small menu is easy to miss and requires more focus, so expect people to use the main action button in most cases.

When there isn’t a clear default action, present all options equally using a [basic dropdown menu](/components/dropdown-menu/examples) or [button group](/components/button-group/examples).

## Accessibility

<!-- TODO review with a11y team and break into more scannable headings. Tooltip info may be better off in tooltop docs and linked to here. -->

- Use a tooltip and an aria label (using the aria-label prop) to describe the actions behind the dropdown icon button. The text should say something like "More 'main action' actions."
- Avoid disabling buttons and follow all [general button accessibility guidance](/components/button/usage#accessibility).

## Best practices

<!-- TODO add do/don’ts and visuals throughout. -->

- Try to keep the number of dropdown menus items to a minimum (less than six) to aid focus and comprehension.
- Remember that some users may miss the secondary action entirely, so ensure users aren’t required to interact with the secondary action to proceed. In other words, make sure the main action button allows people to proceed in most cases.

### Secondary actions should open a dropdown menu

In general, the secondary action button opens a dropdown menu.

When the secondary action doesn’t open a dropdown menu, don’t use a dropdown icon like the chevron down. Make sure any icon button provides a clear and consistent signifier that relates to the purpose of that action.

If you are customizing the secondary action menu (not a dropdown), strongly consider whether these actions are really directly related, with one being a clear default. In most cases, a separate button may be more appropriate than a split button with a custom icon.

## Content guidelines

<!-- TODO make scannable headings with do/don'ts (reuse from button docs?) -->

- Don’t repeat the default action button as a dropdown menu item. Try to keep the number of menu items to a minimum.
- Use sentence case (only capitalize the first letter) for all button actions and menu items, unless there’s a proper noun in the label.

## Mobile guidelines

Avoid using split buttons in mobile experiences. The menu button touch target is small and easy to miss accidentally.

- To group actions that are dissimilar or of equal importance, use a [button group](/components/button-group/examples) or a [basic dropdown menu](/components/dropdown-menu/examples) to present options more equally.
- To present more actions in views with limited space, use an [icon button as a more actions (…) menu](/components/button/icon-button/examples).
- In navigation, use a [basic navigation dropdown](/components/atlassian-navigation/examples) to simplify.
