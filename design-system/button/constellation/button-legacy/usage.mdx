## Usage

Buttons are triggers for events or actions. They’re a common part of larger experiences such as
[forms](/patterns/forms) or [modal dialogs](/components/modal-dialog).

![Button diagram. A caption follows this image.](images/button-anatomy.png)

Buttons typically have a label and can include an icon before or after the label.

1. **Icon (optional):** Most buttons don't need an icon. Use an icon to add additional affordance
   where the icon has a clear and well-established meaning.
2. **Label:** Text that explains the result of selecting the button. Use action verbs or phrases to
   tell the user what will happen next, and follow the
   [button label content guidelines](/components/button/button-legacy/usage#content-guidelines).

### Use one primary call to action

Only include one primary button or call to action (CTA) in a page or area of UI.

Primary buttons indicate the most important action in a group or area. Having multiple primary CTAs
in one area can be confusing or visually overwhelming.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonPrimaryDo,
		alt: 'Two buttons in a group. One says cancel and is grey, the other says primary and is blue, making it the more promenint call to action.',
	}}
>
	Use one primary call to action to help people proceed.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: buttonPrimaryDont,
		alt: 'Two buttons in a group. One says cancel and the other says primary. Both are primary blue, causing them to compete for attention.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use many calls to action in one page or container.
</DoDont>

### Consider button sizes in context

Make sure the button is large enough to interact with but not visually overwhelming. There is a
[compact button](/components/button/button-legacy/examples#spacing) for tight spaces.

### Use buttons for actions and links for navigation

Buttons are for actions that affect something on the current page, such as submitting a form,
playing media, or closing a modal.

Links navigate to a new page or anchor location, changing the URL.

In general, don’t use a `<button>` in place of a link (`<a>`) or a link in place of a button. HTML
buttons and links are treated differently by assistive technologies such as screen readers, so using
the wrong one can make experiences harder to use for some people.

## Accessibility

### Include aria labels for icon-only buttons

- Include alternative text using the `aria-label` prop when using icon-only buttons.
- When using an icon alongside text, do not add a label to the icon. Doing so will unnecessarily
  repeat labels for people using screen readers.

### Avoid disabling buttons

Avoid using disabled buttons, especially in forms. Disabled buttons don't explain why the button
isn't usable, and they aren't focusable at all for people using keyboard navigation.

Instead, keep the button pressable, and use validation and errors to explain what needs to be done
to proceed.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonDisableDo,
		alt: 'A form that is incomplete. The button remains visible and pressable, and validation text explains what must be done to proceed.',
	}}
>
	Use validation or other clear on-screen directions to help people proceed.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: buttonDisableDont,
		alt: 'A form that is incomplete. The button is disabled and light grey in color, which is difficult to see. There is no explanation of what to do to proceed.',
	}}
>
	Don’t disable form submission buttons, as this doesn't give people clear a direction for how to
	proceed.
</DoDont>

### Don't put tooltips on disabled buttons

This is not accessible. Disabled buttons aren't reachable in the tab order and don't receive hover,
focus, or click events. Don't attempt to create workarounds. If you are an Atlassian, Accessibility
QA will make you redesign these implementations.

Some questions you should ask if you feel you need a tooltip on a disabled button:

- Is this information **essential** to the user experience? If so, don’t hide it behind a tooltip.
  Tooltips aren’t easy to discover and aren’t accessible on mobile. If it isn’t essential, consider
  whether you need to show it at all.
- Is this information **actionable**? Being shown things that you can’t use without any actionable
  next step can be frustrating or confusing. Consider only showing UI that a user is able to
  interact with, or replacing the disabled button with text that has the same content you were going
  to put in the tooltip. If you do this, you can make things even more actionable for the user by
  providing a link to a next step that they can take, or further information.

We know that disabled buttons with tooltips are sometimes used to promote feature discovery. We are
working to provide guidance for this use case in the future.

### Focus behavior

<!-- TODO: make example showcasing this behavior. Would be ideal to remove from usage and have as an example instead. -->

By default `tabIndex={0}` is added when the `component` prop is specified, so the button element can
get browser focus regardless of the element type used.

On a `mousedown`, `event.preventDefault()` is always called to prevent the button from getting
focus. This is questionable behavior that we hope to change in future.

When a native `<button>` is disabled, it loses browser focus and cannot be focused. We replicate
this behavior by setting `tabIndex={-1}` on the button element and calling `element.blur()` when a
button becomes disabled (`isDisabled` prop is set to true).

## Best practices

### Alignment and positioning

In general, the primary button or main CTA should match the alignment of the button group. For
example, right aligned button groups place the primary button on the right. Left aligned button
groups would place the primary button on the left.

**Right align** buttons for focussed tasks, series of tasks (such as
[onboarding](/components/onboarding)), and [modal dialogs](/components/modal-dialog). Right aligning
buttons is best for experiences with less copy, so users end scanning on the most important action
(following a Z-pattern).

**Left align** buttons for single-page forms and other full-page tasks where there is a lot of
content in view. This aligns with how people scan full pages with more content (F-pattern), sorting
by importance from left to right. Cards can also left-align the primary action, as they're typically
part of a larger page experience.

Exceptions: Benefits modals and login forms currently center align buttons.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonAlignmentModal,
		alt: 'Buttons aligned to the right in a modal dialog, with the primary action furthest right.',
	}}
>
	Right-align buttons for focussed tasks, modal dialogs, and other areas with less content.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonAlignmentPage,
		alt: 'Buttons aligned to the left in a full-page layout, with the primary action furthest left.',
	}}
>
	Left align buttons on full-page forms, long lists of cards, or other screens with a lot of
	full-page content.
</DoDont>

Form patterns show more detailed [button alignment diagrams](/patterns/forms#button-positioning).

## Content guidelines

### Use sentence case capitalization

Only capitalize the first letter of the button and any proper nouns. (Most feature names aren’t
capitalized or considered proper nouns when following
[our capitalization guidance](/content/language-and-grammar#capitalization).)

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonCapitalizationDo,
		alt: 'Button that says Complete sprint. Only the first letter is capitalized.',
	}}
>
	Use sentence-case capitalization.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: buttonCapitalizationDont,
		alt: 'Buttons that say Complete sprint text in title case and all caps.',
	}}
>
	Use title case capitalization or all caps.
</DoDont>

### Keep button labels short

Keep labels short and free of punctuation. Drop unnecessary articles, such as ‘a’ or ‘the’, for a
more concise label.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonConciseDo,
		alt: 'Button that says Reset Password.',
	}}
>
	Use concise, easy to scan button labels to describe the action.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: buttonConciseDont,
		alt: 'Button that says Send a password reset email.',
	}}
>
	Use long, redundant button labels.
</DoDont>

### Use specific labels wherever possible

Start with the verb and specify what is being acted on. Use dynamic text to make the button very
specific if posible.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonActionDo,
		alt: 'Text that asks delete unpublished page? Followed by a delete CTA button and a cancel button',
	}}
>
	Use active verbs or phrases that clearly indicate action.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: buttonActionDont,
		alt: 'Text that asks delete unpublished page? Followed by a Yes CTA button and a No button',
	}}
>
	Use vague and generic labels that make the user read the dialog before taking action.
</DoDont>

### Make labels consistent with other UI in view

For example, if a button is part of a larger modal, use the same language in the button as in
headings and other related text.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: buttonLabelDo,
		alt: 'Confirmation modal asking do you want to discard? Button label also says Discard',
	}}
>
	Use consistent language for the button and other text descibing the same action.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: buttonLabelDont,
		alt: 'Confirmation modal asking do you want to discard? Button label says Delete',
	}}
>
	Use different words to refer to the same action.
</DoDont>

## Technical considerations

<!-- TODO: These topics should all be examples for their respective props or behaviors. Leave as is for old button docs, but double check new button how these use cases work and put examples in the right spots. -->

### Behavior

Each button variation (`Button`, `LoadingButton` and `CustomThemeButton`) will render out a
`<button>` element, an `<a>` element if a `href` prop is supplied, or render any other element type
by using the component prop (for example, `component="span"`). Each button element looks and behaves
similarly, regardless of element tag, as it is guided by the native `<button>` behavior.

A `role` prop is inferred from the element type or you can pass in a `role` prop if you need to.

### Buttons with an overlay

<!-- TODO: This info should live with the loading button example and/or overlay prop description. Also, loading button should technically be it's own page, but we're leaving it as is since old button is old. -->

Buttons support an overlay element, which is used to display a spinner for
`LoadingButton > isLoading`. When there is an overlay, the normal button content fades out and the
button is non-interactive but not disabled.

A `button` with an overlay:

- will block events as if it is disabled
- won’t lose focus automatically when the overlay is shown (unlike when it is disabled, where the
  focus is lost)
- allows focus to be given and removed from the element

The button will not show `:active` and `:hover` styles and otherwise keeps the same visual and
cursor experience as if it did not have an overlay.

### Adding event listeners

For the most consistent behavior across elements, it’s safest to use bubble phase listeners on the
button element and parent elements, for example, use `onClick` rather than `onClickCapture`.
Although, event listeners _can_ be added in either the capture or bubble phase on the button
element.

Bubble and capture event listeners will not be called when the button component is disabled.

For elements that are parents of a button you need to bind on the bubble phase (for example,
`onClick`) since button does not abort the event until the capture phase. So as the event goes down
the DOM tree in the capture phase, it’s not aborted until it reaches the button element. This means
you will get a click event from a button on parents in the capture phase. A workaround is to add
events to the window when disabled and stop the event a bit earlier, but that's a bit heavy.
