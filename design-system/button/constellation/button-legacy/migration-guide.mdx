## Migrate to use the new button components

New button components with improved APIs are here. If you're using the old `@atlaskit/button`, you can start migrating some default and loading button usages to the [new button](/components/button), [icon button](/components/button/icon-button), and [link button](/components/button/link-button) today.

## Use the codemod for automated migration assistance

Run the following command in your terminal, replacing the path with a path to the file you'd like to migrate.

```shell
npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -n migrate-to-new-buttons --extensions tsx --parser tsx <path-to-your-file-or-package>
```

This finds all eligible buttons and migrates them to use the new components, adding commented tasks for things you may want to review. (If this doesn't work, [make sure your environment is set up properly](/get-started/develop).)

## What do migrations look like using the codemod?

Here is what the codemod will do for all migratable buttons.

### Code changes when migrating default buttons

**Before**

```TSX
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';

const App = () => (
  <Button
    appearance="primary"
    onClick={onClick}
  >
    Default button
  </Button >
);
```

**After**

```TSX
import Button from '@atlaskit/button/new';

const App = () => (
  <Button
    appearance="primary"
    onClick={onClick}
  >
    Default button
  </Button >
);
```

### Code changes when migrating icon buttons

**Before**

```TSX
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';
import AddIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/add';

const App = () => (
  <Button
    iconBefore={<AddIcon label="more" />}
    onClick={onClick}
  />
);
```

**After**

```TSX
import { IconButton } from '@atlaskit/button/new';
import AddIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/add';

const App = () => (
  <IconButton
    icon={AddIcon}
    label="more"
    onClick={onClick}
  />
);
```

### Tasks

Some buttons may require additional changes. The codemod will mark these for you with instructions on how to manually configure the new button. For example:

```
// TODO: (from codemod) Buttons with "component", "css" or "style" prop can't be automatically migrated with codemods. Please migrate it manually.
```

For details on each type of button and what the codemod will do for each one, view the [Atlassian migration details (Atlassians only)](https://go.atlassian.com/button-migration-guide).

### Visual changes

Some of the new buttons have minor visual changes that can impact VR tests. In particular, some buttons with icons have slight visual changes that impact tests. These icon spacing changes were intentional to improve the look and feel of the icon buttons.

Legacy button imported from `@atlaskit/button@17.2.1` or an earlier version has a wider padding around the icon:

![legacy button](images/legacy-button.png)

New button:
![new button](images/new-button.png)

### DOM element changes

Buttons with only icons and no visible labels need accessible labels. The legacy Button component supports this through the button `aria-label` attribute or the `label` prop on the icon component.

In new icon buttons, we have added a `label` prop which is required. This is rendered as content inside the icon button using [visually hidden](/components/visually-hidden/examples). The text is visually hidden, but still functions in all ways as regular text on a page.
This means it is translatable, and readable by screenreaders.

## What buttons can't be migrated automatically yet?

These buttons are still being developed and reviewed in the new designs, or they just can't be migrated automatically yet. Here's what to do in these situations:

| Old button property                                             | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appearance` set to `link` or `subtle link` on non-link buttons | Consider using [semantically correct buttons and links](/components/button/usage#use-buttons-for-actions-and-links-for-navigation) instead, or the new Link component or Anchor primitive. |
| `style` or `css` props                                          | Consider using [Pressable](/components/primitives/pressable) to build custom buttons with Atlassian Design System styling.                                                                 |
| `component` property                                            | Buttons using `component` prop for routing can be migrated to the new [link button](/components/button/link-button).                                                                       |

<SectionMessage>
  Not all old buttons have a 1:1 replacement in the new components. We're still
  working to cover all valid uses in the new APIs. For now, we recommend
  migrating the buttons you can and waiting for an update on the ones you can't
  migrate yet.
</SectionMessage>

If you have a button that can't be migrated or changed, keep using legacy buttons from `@atlaskit/button` for now, and monitor this page or the [button changelogs](/components/button/changelog) for updates.
