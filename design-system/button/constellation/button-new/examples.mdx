## Default

The default form of a button, used for most cases. They are not impactful enough to represent the primary action in a container.

<Example Component={ButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a `primary` button to call attention to an action on a [form](/patterns/forms) or to highlight the strongest call to action on a page.
Primary buttons should only appear once per container (not including the application header or in a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog)). Not every screen requires a primary button.

<Example Component={ButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use a `subtle` button with a `primary` button for secondary actions, such as â€œCancel".

<Example Component={ButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

A `warning` button appears before we request the user to take action, usually in anticipation of a significant change. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

The `danger` button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive action such as deleting. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

<SectionMessage title="Differs to legacy button" appearance="information">
  <p>
    The following appearances are only supported on new{' '}
    <a href="#link-button">Link Buttons</a>, however on the legacy button they
    were available when using buttons as links such as:{' '}
    <inlineCode>&lt;Button href="/home" appearance="link"&gt;</inlineCode>.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    It's not necessary for <inlineCode>&lt;button&gt;</inlineCode> elements to
    appear as text links. If your button is being used as a link in combination
    with these appearances, reconsider your approach.
  </p>
</SectionMessage>

### Link

Use a `link` appearance on buttons that should appear similar to inline text links. This is only supported for <a href="#link-button">Link Buttons</a>.

<Example Component={ButtonLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle link

Similar to a `subtle` button, but behaves like a `link` appearance button. Use a `subtle-link` button to avoid overwhelming the page with blue links. This is only supported for <a href="#link-button">Link Buttons</a>.

<Example Component={ButtonSubtleLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Link button

When buttons are links rather than triggering actions. This will render an `<a>` tag instead of a `<button>`. It accepts anchor tag HTML attributes, including `href`.

<Example Component={LinkButton} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Routing

When available, Link Button will consume the router link component configured in the **App provider**. This allows router links to be configured once across an entire application.

When appropriate, certain links passed to `href` **will not** utilize the configured router link component and instead render a standard `<a>` tag. These include:

- External links
- Non-HTTP-based links (`mailto:`, `tel:`, `sms:`)
- Anchor / hash links (`#`)

If your application does not have an existing App Provider or `routerLinkComponent` configuration, see [the documentation](/components/app-provider/examples#router-links) for guidance on setting this up.

_This replaces [the component prop](/components/button/examples#routing) from the legacy button._

#### Advanced `href` usage with TypeScript

Link Button accepts a generic type containing the configured router link's props. This is only required for advanced usage to allow an object to be passed to `href`.

<Example
  Component={LinkButtonWithRouting}
  packageName="@atlaskit/button"
  appearance="source-only"
/>

## States

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable a button that should not be actionable. The button will appear faded and will not respond to user interaction.

Disabled buttons can cause accessibility issues as disabled elements are not in the tab order, so wherever possible avoid using `isDisabled`, especially for form submit buttons.

You should never put a tooltip on a disabled button. For more information see our [usage guidelines](/components/button-new/usage#do-not-put-tooltips-on-disabled-buttons).

<Example Component={ButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

#### Disabled Link buttons

Standard buttons utilize the `disabled` HTML attribute, however this does not exist for anchor `<a>` tags, so **LinkButton** is disabled using an accessible technique:

- Adds `aria-disabled="true"`
- Adds `role="link"`
- Removes `href` attribute

<Example Component={LinkButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Example Component={ButtonSelected} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Spacing

Buttons can have various spacing. Default spacing is used for most use cases, compact for tables and none for breadcrumbs.

<Example Component={ButtonPadding} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Full width

Buttons can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example Component={ButtonFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Button with icon

Buttons may include an icon before or after the text.

### Icon before

Display an icon before the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBefore} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Icon after

Display an icon after the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Overriding icon size

To override the default icon size, use `UNSAFE_iconBefore_size` or `UNSAFE_iconAfter_size`.

<SectionMessage title="Caution" appearance="warning">
  <p>
    This is an UNSAFE prop which will be removed in a later version. There are
    plans to revise iconography to provide consistent sizing at which point this
    will no longer be necessary.
  </p>
</SectionMessage>

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBeforeSize} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Truncation

Text will truncate when buttons are used in a narrow container. This prevents wrapping onto a new line and breaking layout. An ellipsis will be added to the end to indicate that the text has been truncated.

The truncation is implemented with styles, so screen readers will still read the full text.

Avoid truncation whenever possible. For more information see [truncation](/content/language-and-grammar#truncation).

<Example Component={ButtonTruncation} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Overlays

Content can overlay buttons for purposes such as loading states. This is not recommended for most use cases.

When the `overlay` prop is set, the button will be disabled and block user interaction.

<SectionMessage title="Caution" appearance="warning">
  <p>
    This feature has been carried over from the legacy button, but may be
    removed in the future. Please use with caution.
  </p>
</SectionMessage>

<Example Component={ButtonOverlay} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Custom buttons

<SectionMessage title="Coming soon" appearance="information">
  <p>
    The legacy Button's{' '}
    <a href="/components/button/examples#custom-theme-button-not-recommended">
      CustomThemeButton
    </a>{' '}
    solution for creating custom buttons will soon be deprecated. We're still
    working on implementing a replacement for this in the new Button with safe
    style overrides using <a href="/components/primitives/xcss/usage">xcss</a>.
  </p>
