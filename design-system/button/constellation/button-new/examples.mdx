## Default

Use default buttons for most actions that aren't the main call to action for a page or area. Default buttons are less prominent than primary buttons.

<Example Component={ButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a primary button to call attention to a [form](/patterns/forms) submission or to highlight the most important call to action on a page.
Primary buttons should only appear once per area, but not every screen needs a primary button.

<Example Component={ButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use a subtle button with a primary button for secondary actions, such as “Cancel”.

<Example Component={ButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

Warning buttons confirm actions that may cause a significant change or a loss of data.

Warnings alert people of a problem that might happen if they proceed. These appearances are often used in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

A danger button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive and irreversible action, such as deleting.

<Example Component={ButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## States

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable a button that shouldn't be actionable. The button will appear faded and won't respond to user interaction.

Disabled buttons can cause accessibility issues (disabled elements are not in the tab order) so wherever possible, avoid using `isDisabled`.
Instead, use [validation](/components/button/button-new/usage) or other techniques to show users how to proceed.

<Example Component={ButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Example Component={ButtonSelected} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Loading

When a button is still loading and not actionable, a loading spinner can be displayed in place of the button label. This also disables the button and blocks user interaction.

<Example Component={ButtonLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Spacing

Button spacing depends on the surrounding UI. Default spacing is used for most use cases, `compact` for tables, and `none` for breadcrumbs.

<Example Component={ButtonSpacing} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Full width

Buttons can expand to full width to fill the parent container. This is sometimes done in login forms. Follow the [alignment guidance](/components/button/button-new/examples#alignment-and-positioning) for more options.

<Example Component={ButtonFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Button with icon

Buttons may include an icon before or after the text label. For an icon-only button, see [icon button](/components/button/icon-button).

### Icon before

Display an icon before the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBefore} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Icon after

Display an icon after the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Overriding icon props

Use the `iconBefore` or `iconAfter` render prop to override the default icon props.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBeforeSize} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Truncation

Avoid truncation whenever possible. Make sure there's always a way to access the full content for all users.

Text will truncate when buttons are in a narrow container to prevent wrapping onto a new line and breaking layouts. An ellipsis will be added to the end to indicate that the text has been truncated.

The truncation is implemented with styles, so screen readers will still read the full text.

For more information see [truncation](/content/language-and-grammar#truncation).

<Example Component={ButtonTruncation} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />
