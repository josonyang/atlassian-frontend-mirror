## Default

Use default buttons for most actions that aren't the main call to action for a page or area. Default buttons are less prominent than primary buttons.

<Example Component={ButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a primary button to call attention to a [form](/patterns/forms) submission or to highlight the most important call to action on a page.
Primary buttons should only appear once per area, but not every screen needs a primary button.

<Example Component={ButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use a subtle button with a primary button for secondary actions, such as “Cancel”.

<Example Component={ButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

Warning buttons confirm actions that may cause a significant change or a loss of data.

Typically, warnings alert people of a problem that might happen if they proceed. These apperances are often found in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

A danger button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive and irreversible action, such as deleting.

<Example Component={ButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Link buttons

Use [Link button](/components/button/link-button) for buttons that navigate to a new location or anchor.

Follow the usage guidance for [when to use links and buttons](/components/button/button-new/usage#use-buttons-for-actions-and-links-for-navigation).

### Link appearance

<SectionMessage title="Updates to link handling" appearance="information">
  <p>
    Link appearances now only support semantically correct links using{' '}
    <a href="#link-button">link button</a>. If you have a legacy button that's
    being used as a link, consider replacing with the new link button or using
    another approach.
  </p>
</SectionMessage>

Use a link appearance for buttons that look and behave like inline text links. This is only supported for <a href="#link-button">link buttons</a>.

<Example Component={ButtonLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle link appearance

Similar to a subtle button, but looks like a link. Use a `subtle link` button to avoid overwhelming a page with blue links.

Make sure designs have clear affordances for interactable areas and elements. Because there is no color affordance, this style of button relies on the context around it to show that it can be interacted with.

<Example Component={ButtonSubtleLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## States

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable a button that shouldn't be actionable. The button will appear faded and won't respond to user interaction.

Disabled buttons can cause accessibility issues (disabled elements are not in the tab order) so wherever possible, avoid using `isDisabled`.
Instead, use [validation](/components/button/button-new/usage) or other techniques to show users how to proceed.

<Example Component={ButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Example Component={ButtonSelected} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Loading

When a button is still loading and not actionable, a loading spinner can be displayed in place of the button label. This also disables the button and blocks user interaction.

<Example Component={ButtonLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Spacing

Button spacing depends on the surrounding UI. Default spacing is used for most use cases, `compact` for tables, and `none` for breadcrumbs.

<Example Component={ButtonSpacing} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Full width

Buttons can expand to full width to fill the parent container. This is sometimes done in login forms. Follow the [alignment guidance](/components/button/button-new/examples#alignment-and-positioning) for more options.

<Example Component={ButtonFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Button with icon

Buttons may include an icon before or after the text label. For an icon-only button, see [icon button](/components/button/icon-button).

### Icon before

Display an icon before the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBefore} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Icon after

Display an icon after the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Overriding icon size

To override the default icon size, use the `iconBefore` or `iconAfter` render prop.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBeforeSize} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Truncation

Avoid truncation whenever possible. Make sure there is always a way to access the full content for all users.

Text will truncate when buttons are in a narrow container to prevent wrapping onto a new line and breaking layouts. An ellipsis will be added to the end to indicate that the text has been truncated.

The truncation is implemented with styles, so screen readers will still read the full text.

For more information see [truncation](/content/language-and-grammar#truncation).

<Example Component={ButtonTruncation} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Custom buttons

    The legacy{' '}
    <a href="/components/button/examples#custom-theme-button-not-recommended">
      CustomThemeButton

    will soon be deprecated. We're working on a replacement for this with safe
    style overrides using <a href="/components/primitives/xcss/usage">XCSS</a>.
