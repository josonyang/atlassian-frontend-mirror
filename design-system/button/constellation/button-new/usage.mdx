## Usage

Buttons are triggers for events or actions. They’re a common part of larger experiences such as [forms](/patterns/forms) or [modal dialogs](/components/modal-dialog).

Buttons typically have a label and can include an icon before or after the label.

1. **Label:** Text describing the button action. Use action verbs or phrases to tell the user what will happen next, and follow the [button label content guidelines](/components/button/button-new/usage#content-guidelines).
1. **Button:** The selectable area of the button.
1. **Icon (optional):** Most buttons don’t need an icon. Use an icon to add additional affordance where the icon has a clear and well-established meaning.

### Use one primary call to action

Only include one primary button or call to action (CTA) in a page or area of UI.

Primary buttons indicate the most important action in a group or area. Having multiple primary CTAs in one area can be confusing or visually overwhelming because they compete for attention.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: buttonPrimaryDo,
    alt: 'Two buttons in a group. One says cancel and is grey, the other says primary and is blue, making it the more promenint call to action.',
  }}
>
  Use one primary call to action to help people proceed.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: buttonPrimaryDont,
    alt: 'Two buttons in a group. One says cancel and the other says primary. Both are primary blue, causing them to compete for attention.',
  }}
>
  Don’t use many calls to action in one page or container.
</DoDont>

### Consider button sizes in context

Make sure the button is large enough to interact with but not visually overwhelming. There is a [compact button](/components/button/examples#spacing) for tight spaces.

### Use buttons for actions and links for navigation

Buttons are for actions that affect something on the current page, such as submitting a form, playing media, or closing a modal.

Links navigate to a new page or anchor location, changing the URL.

In general, don’t use a `<button>` in place of a link (`<a>`) or a link in place of a button. HTML buttons and links are treated differently by assistive technologies such as screen readers, so using the wrong one can make experiences harder to use for some people.

## Accessibility

### Avoid disabling buttons

Avoid disabling buttons, especially in forms. Instead, keep the button pressable, and use validation and errors to explain what needs to be done to proceed.

Disabled buttons don’t explain why the button isn’t usable. They also aren’t reachable in the tab order and don’t receive hover, focus, or click events, making them entirely inaccessible to some people.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: buttonDisableDo,
    alt: 'A form that is incomplete. The button remains visible and pressable, and validation text explains what must be done to proceed.',
  }}
>
  Use validation or other clear on-screen directions to help people proceed.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: buttonDisableDont,
    alt: 'A form that is incomplete. The button is disabled and light grey in color, which is difficult to see. There is no explanation of what to do to proceed.',
  }}
>
  Don’t disable form submission buttons, as this doesn't give people clear a
  direction for how to proceed.
</DoDont>

### Never put tooltips on disabled buttons

Tooltips can't be reached on all devices or by some assitive technologies, and they should never appear on elements that aren't interactable.

<!-- Don’t attempt to create workarounds. If you are an Atlassian, Accessibility QA will make you redesign these implementations. -->

Things to consider before using a tooltip:

- Is this information **essential** to the user experience? If so, never hide it behind a tooltip. Tooltips aren’t easy to discover and aren’t accessible at all on mobile devices. If it isn’t essential information, consider if you need to show it at all.
- Is this information **actionable**? Being shown things that you can’t use without any next steps can be frustrating or confusing. Consider only showing UI that a user can interact with.
- If the information is still necessary or helpful, consider using helper text or other more accessible text that has the same content instead of a tooltip. This gives you more options to provide a link to a next step or another relevant action.

<!-- We know that disabled buttons with tooltips are sometimes used for feature discovery. We're working on guidance for this case. -->

<!-- TODO: make example showcasing focus behavior. Would be ideal to remove from usage and have as an example instead. -->

## Content guidelines

### Use sentence case capitalization

Only capitalize the first letter of the button and any proper nouns. Most feature names aren’t capitalized or considered proper nouns when following [our capitalization guidance](/content/language-and-grammar#capitalization).

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: buttonCapitalizationDo,
    alt: 'Button that says Complete sprint. Only the first letter is capitalized.',
  }}
>
  Use sentence-case capitalization.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: buttonCapitalizationDont,
    alt: 'Buttons that say Complete sprint text in title case and all caps.',
  }}
>
  Use title case capitalization or all caps.
</DoDont>

### Keep button labels short

Keep labels short and free of punctuation. Drop unnecessary articles, such as ‘a’ or ‘the’, for a more concise label.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: buttonConciseDo,
    alt: 'Button that says Reset Password.',
  }}
>
  Use concise, easy to scan button labels to describe the action.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: buttonConciseDont,
    alt: 'Button that says Send a password reset email.',
  }}
>
  Use long, redundant button labels.
</DoDont>

### Use specific labels wherever possible

Start with the verb and specify what is being acted on. Use dynamic text to make the button very specific if possible.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: buttonActionDo,
    alt: 'Text that asks delete unpublished page? Followed by a delete CTA button and a cancel button',
  }}
>
  Use active verbs or phrases that clearly indicate action.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: buttonActionDont,
    alt: 'Text that asks delete unpublished page? Followed by a Yes CTA button and a No button',
  }}
>
  Use vague and generic labels that make the user read the dialog before taking
  action.
</DoDont>

### Make labels consistent with other UI in view

For example, if a button is part of a larger modal, use the same language in the button as in headings and other related text.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: buttonLabelDo,
    alt: 'Confirmation modal asking do you want to discard? Button label also says Discard',
  }}
>
  Use consistent language for the button and other text descibing the same
  action.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: buttonLabelDont,
    alt: 'Confirmation modal asking do you want to discard? Button label says Delete',
  }}
>
  Use different words to refer to the same action.
</DoDont>
