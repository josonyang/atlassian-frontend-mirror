## Usage

Use pagination when there are too many results to show on one page, so that people aren't
overwhelmed by too much information. Pagination is a control that sits at the bottom of the page and
allows the user to easily move between each page.

Pagination is commonly used for things like table listings, search results, and directories. What
constitutes “too many results” can be influenced by:

- system load times
- the amount of data in each entry
- the available screen space

## Anatomy

![The pagination component is a horizontal list of page numbers with navigation arrows at each end.](./images/pagination-anatomy.png)

1. **Previous and next:** Arrow icons that people use to move backward and forward from the
   currently selected page.
2. **Page navigation:** Numbers that people can select to move to a specific page.
3. **Truncation:** When a threshold of pages is reached, the list is truncated using an ellipsis.

## Behavior

- The ellipsis representing truncated pages isn't interactive. To reach page numbers that are
  truncated, people need to move to a page number that is closer to the number in the series. For
  example, in a pagination component numbered 1-5, people need to select 5 to reveal page 6.
- Double truncation is used when the current page is separated by more than five pages from both the
  first and last page.

## Accessibility

- Using `aria-label` attributes improves the experience for people who use assistive technologies,
  like screen readers and speech recognition software.
- Use the `label`, `pageLabel`, `nextLabel`, and `previousLabel` props to provide labels for the
  pagination buttons. While the default label props are in English, passing these props will ensure
  that assistive technologies in non-English languages can properly identify the content.
- Be mindful of people using your product on small screen sizes and adjust the maximum number of
  pages accordingly.

## Best practices

- For smaller screens, show a maximum of seven pages (including the ellipsis).
- For larger screens, show a maximum of 14 pages (including the ellipsis).

- Each page in the pagination control is a [button link](/components/button) that lets people
  quickly navigate through the results.
- This component is mostly used with tables, see [dynamic table](/components/dynamic-table/examples)
