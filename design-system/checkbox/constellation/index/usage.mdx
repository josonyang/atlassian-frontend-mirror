## Usage

Usually used in forms, checkboxes collect input from users. They can select a number of options ranging from zero to multiple options.

Use checkboxes when:

- People need to select one or more options from a list of related items.
- You need an explicit confirmation from the user to apply settings.

## Anatomy

![The checkbox component is made of two parts: the checkbox selection control is a box that can be checked or empty. The checkbox label is text to the right of the control.](images/anatomy-checkbox.png)

1. **Checkbox**: The selection control.
2. **Checkbox label**: Use this text label to describe what the checkbox is for.

## Behavior

- Individual checkboxes have two states: selected and unselected.
- When checkboxes are grouped, there are three states: selected, unselected, and indeterminate. The parent checkbox shows an indeterminate state when some, but not all of the child checkboxes are selected.

## Accessibility

- Include error messages for required or invalid checkbox fields (for example, "Please select an option").
- Donâ€™t use a disabled checkbox if it needs to remain in the tab order. Instead, use validation so that screen reader users can perceive the checkbox and hear an error message explaining why that option cannot currently be selected.

## Content guidelines

- Keep checkbox labels short and descriptive.
- Don't include punctuation after checkbox labels.
