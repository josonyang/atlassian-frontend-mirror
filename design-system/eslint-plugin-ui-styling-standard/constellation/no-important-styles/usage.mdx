# no-important-styles

This rule prevents the usage of the `!important` flag in style declarations.

Properly composed styles will never need an `!important` flag. It is used to override specificity
when working across different scopes, and the UI Styling Standard enforces styles with minimal
scope.

The use of `!important` is a code smell and greatly impacts readability and determinism.
