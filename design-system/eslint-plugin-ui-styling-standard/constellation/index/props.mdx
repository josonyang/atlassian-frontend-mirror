You must use the recommended config to follow the styling standards at Atlassian,
which will ensure compatability and performance with the design system.

```diff
module.exports = {
  extends: [
+    'plugin:@atlaskit/ui-styling-standard/recommended',
  ],
};
```

We don't recommended maintaining your own configuration.
If you do not use our config you will need to specify individual rules and configuration.
Add the plugin to your `.eslintrc.js` file.

```diff
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
+    '@atlaskit/ui-styling-standard',
  ],
};
```

Enable individual rules as that you're ready to adopt.

```diff
module.exports = {
  rules: [
+    '@atlaskit/design-system/consistent-css-prop-usage': 'error',
+    '@atlaskit/design-system/local-cx-xcss': 'error',
  ],
};
```
