You must use the recommended config to follow the styling standards at Atlassian, which will ensure
compatability and performance with the design system.

```diff
module.exports = {
  extends: [
+    'plugin:@atlaskit/ui-styling-standard/recommended',
  ],
};
```

We don't recommended maintaining your own configuration. If you do not use our config you will need
to specify individual rules and configuration. Add the plugin to your `.eslintrc.js` file and enable
individual rules as you're ready to adopt.

```diff
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
+    '@atlaskit/ui-styling-standard',
  ],
  rules: [
+    '@atlaskit/ui-styling-standard/convert-props-syntax': 'warn',
+    '@atlaskit/design-system/local-cx-xcss': 'error',
  ],
};
```
