# @atlaskit/design-system/no-exported-keyframes

Forbid exporting `keyframes` function calls. Exporting `css` function calls can result in unexpected behaviour at runtime, and is not statically analysable.

This rule is maintained by another package and configured here; refer to https://atlassian.design/components/eslint-plugin-design-system/no-exported-keyframes/usage for more details.
