# @atlaskit/design-system/no-invalid-css-map

Ensure that all usages of the cssMap API are valid, and enforces the format of the object that is
passed to cssMap. This is intended to be used alongside TypeScript's type-checking.

This rule is maintained by another package and configured here; refer to
https://atlassian.design/components/eslint-plugin-design-system/no-invalid-css-map/usage for more
details.
