# @atlaskit/design-system/no-exported-css

Forbid exporting `css` function calls. Exporting `css` function calls can result in unexpected
behaviour at runtime, and is not statically analysable.

This rule is maintained by another package and configured here; refer to
https://atlassian.design/components/eslint-plugin-design-system/no-exported-css/usage for more
details.
