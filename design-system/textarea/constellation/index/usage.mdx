## Usage

Use text areas to let people enter long-form plain text that spans over multiple lines, in an area that can expand in height. Text areas are normally used in [forms](/patterns/forms).

## Anatomy

![The text area component is made up of four parts, a label that is left-aligned above the field input area, placeholder text which appears inside the input area, and helper text which appears below the input area.](images/anatomy.png)

1. ** Label: ** Indicates the type of information the text area requires.
2. ** Placeholder text (optional):** Avoid placeholders when possible. Never use placeholder text to communicate critical information — this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can be used for example entries that help clarify the text input.
3. ** Input area: ** This is where users enter text.
4. ** Helper text: ** Use this to provide a hint about specific formats the text area will accept (for example, `Enter up to 250 characters`).

## Accessibility

- Always use a label and associate the label to the field properly so that the text area is accessible to assistive technology.
- Avoid using placeholder text whenever possible. Make sure any critical information is communicated either in the field label or using helper text below the field. Search fields or brief examples are exceptions where placeholder text may be OK.

## Content guidelines

- Use a combination of a concise label and helper text to clarify the field input. Don’t rely on placeholder text as it is not visible at all times.
- The label should be a noun string. For example, if the text area appears in a modal called “Create component”, the label for a description text area should only say “Description” and not repeat the modal’s title.
