## Usage

A blanket covers the underlying UI and is intended to be used with layered components, such as a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog).

Use tinted blankets to give visual affordance when the blanket area shouldn’t be interacted with.

## Accessibility

- The blanket is controlled by the layered component that it belongs to, like a modal. Make sure that the layered component provides options to dismiss the layer for keyboard users as well as on click.
- If you allow the components beneath the blanket to be interacted with, don’t include a tint as this reduces color contrast.

## Related
