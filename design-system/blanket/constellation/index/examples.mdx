## Default

A blanket overlays the rest of the page with a transparent grey when used with a modal or popup.

An `onBlanketClicked` prop is provided to catch clicks elsewhere on the page other than the modal or popup. Blanket doesn't have its' own show/hide functionality, it should be controlled with its' parent element.

<Example Component={BlanketBasic} packageName="@atlaskit/blanket" />

## Clickthrough

If you enable the `shouldAllowClickThrough` prop, `onBlanketClicked` doesn't get called and the elements underneath the blanket can be interacted with directly.

<Example Component={BlanketClickthrough} packageName="@atlaskit/blanket" />

## Children

A blanket with children will exclude the children from being tinted by the blanket.
