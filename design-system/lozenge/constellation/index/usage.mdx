## Usage

Lozenges are either subtle or bold.

- Use subtle lozenges by default and in instances where they may dominate the screen, such as in
  long tables with a lot of lozenges.
- Use bold lozenges sparingly and reserve them for things like Pipeline or Jira statuses.
- Combine color with a logical and concise label.

The color system is a consistent visual language that helps people learn to quickly recognize the
meaning of a status across products. For more information, see the
[color foundation.](/foundations/color)

## Accessibility

- Don't use color alone to signify an important state. Instead, use accurate label. For example: for
  an critical status, use words like `Error` or `Warning'.
- Don't use lozenges for long text. Lozenges are not focusable, so any text that gets truncated
  after 200 pixels (or the custom `maxWidth` value) will not be accessible.

## Data Center products

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
