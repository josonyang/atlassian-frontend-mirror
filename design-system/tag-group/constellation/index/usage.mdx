## Usage

Tag groups lay out and align a collection of related [tags](/components/tag/).

In almost every situation, the collection of tags inside a tag group should be a consistent type of tag.

To avoid creating a confusing user experience, don't mix and match removable tags with non-removable tags or have only some tags act as links.

Keep in mind that tags increase the amount of cognitive noise, particularly when combined with other labelling elements, so use them in moderation.
