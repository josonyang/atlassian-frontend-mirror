## Default

By default, a tag group lays out a collection of [tags](/components/tag/) from left to right. It
handles overflow by wrapping to the next line.

Tags inside of a tag group should be of the same type to provide a consistent user experience.

<Example Component={TagGroupDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/tag-group" />

## Alignment

The alignment direction can be set to either the `start` or `end` of the tag group container using
the `alignment` prop. This will also impact the direction of the exiting animation when a removable
tag is removed.

### Start

Set the `alignment` prop to `"start"` to align the tags to the start of the tag group container.
Tags will animate out to the left when removed.

<Example Component={TagGroupAlignmentStart} packageName="@atlaskit/tag-group" />

### End

Set the `alignment` prop to `"end"` to align the tags to the end of the group. Tags will animate out
to the right when removed.

<Example Component={TagGroupAlignmentEnd} packageName="@atlaskit/tag-group" />

## Focus

When a tag is removed, focus should go to the next focusable element on the page, which is likely
the next tag (sibling).

If the removed tag was the last focusable element, move focus to next focusable element after the
trigger. If there are no focusable elements after the trigger, then focus should move to the
previous focusable element before the trigger.

If you remove a tag element from the DOM and don't set the focus, it returns to the body element at
the top of the page. And for people using assistive technology, this means they'll need to navigate
through the entire page to return to where they originally were, which we donâ€™t want.
