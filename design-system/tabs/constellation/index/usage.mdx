## Usage

Tabs are an easy way to organize content by grouping similar information on the same page. People
can view the content without having to navigate away from that page.

## Anatomy

![This is a diagram of the tab header. The example tabs are "Details", "Diff", "Commits" and "Challenges".](images/tabs-anatomy.png)

1. **Selected:** The active tab is blue and underlined.
2. **Unselected:** The other available tabs have text that is lighter.
3. **Divider:** A light visual line separates the tab navigation and content.

## Behavior

Tab behavior during default, focus, hover, and active states are important because it lets people
know where they are in the experience.

![A series of examples of tab visual states. The states are explained below.](images/tabs-behavior.png)

1. **Default:** The standard view.
2. **Focus:** Keyboard focus on a tab.
3. **Hover:** Hovering over a tab.
4. **Press:** Pressing a tab.
5. **Selected:** Indicates the tab that the user is viewing.

## Best practices

Use tabs when you have concise content or content that users need to access regularly.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsConciseDo,
		alt: 'Two tabs with short labels. One says direct, the other says watching.',
	}}
>
	Use tabs for a short list, or any list of content to group that customers use regularly.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsConciseDont,
		alt: 'Five tabs each with long, unrelated labels. From left to right: profile photo, header image, personal information, contact details, and office (cutoff).',
	}}
>
	Don’t use tabs for a long list of content that isn’t used regularly by customers or when space is
	limited.
</DoDont>

### Hierarchy

Maintain content hierarchy within the UI when using tabs, ensuring common information is surfaced in
the right places and information is prioritized appropriately.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsHierarchyDo,
		alt: 'A heading that says what’s on and subtitle that says discover what’s happening in your organisation, stacked vertically, displayed above a group of tabs. The tabs say: following, popular, welcome, and farewell.',
	}}
>
	Use headings or information related to all tabs above the tab line.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsHierarchyDont,
		alt: 'A heading that says what’s on, displayed above a group of tabs. The tabs say: following, popular, welcome, and farewell. A subtitle is inside the popular tab that says discover what’s happening in your organisation.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use information that applies to all tabs underneath the tab line.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsContextDo,
		alt: 'A heading that says internal mobility, displayed above tabs that say: summary, board, list, calendar, and timelines.',
	}}
>
	Use tabs to switch between views within the same context.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsContextDont,
		alt: 'A heading that says your work, displayed above tabs that say: all projects, completed projects, and get invovled. The get involved tab include an icon indicating the tab opens a page in a new window.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use tabs to navigate to different pages, or states.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsImportanceDo,
		alt: 'Tabs that say in order: about, updates, projects, Jira, and learnings.',
	}}
>
	Prioritize tabs by importance or most frequently used.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsImportanceDont,
		alt: 'Tabs that say in order: Jira, projects, learnings, updates, and about.',
	}}
>
	Don’t make important tabs less visible.
</DoDont>

## Grouping

Arrange content in a consistent and effective way with logical and distinct groupings.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsGroupingDo,
		alt: 'Tabs that say in order: worked on, viewed, assigned to me, and starred.',
	}}
>
	Use tabs to logically group information.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsGroupingDont,
		alt: 'Tabs that say in order: worked on, paired with, and get involved.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use tabs to group indistinct information.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsIndependentDo,
		alt: 'Tabs that say in order: attenion board, activity, and scorecards.',
	}}
>
	Use tabs to manage independent data that users don’t need to see simultaneously.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsIndependentDont,
		alt: 'Tabs that say in order: quote number, status, quote total, and customer.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use tabs to separate information that users need at the same time, such as filtering data
	within a single table.
</DoDont>

## Content guidelines

Tab labels provide clear and concise explanations of the content within. When using tabs, make sure
that the content is broken down into categories that make sense and don't overlap.

For example, in a series of instructions about setting up a mobile app, you could use "for iOS", and
"for Android" tabs, but not "Part 1" and "Part 2" tabs.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tabsContentDo,
		alt: 'A search bar that when active displays a menu below with four tabs that say: Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Trello.',
	}}
>
	Write clear and concise tab labels (usually 1-2 words).
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tabsContentDont,
		alt: 'A search bar that when active displays a menu below with two tabs that say: Recently viewed Jira tickets, and starred Confluence pages.',
	}}
>
	Don't write vague and long tab labels which are too complex to understand at a glance.
</DoDont>

## Accessibility

- Keyboard users can navigate between tabs using the left and right arrow keys. The tab key is used
  to navigate to the tab content, not to the next tab. This is so that people who use screen readers
  don't have to tab through all of the tabs to read the content.
- Surface important information outside of tabs, and keep the number of tabs low wherever possible
  in order to increase the visibility of content.
- Avoid complex nesting of interactive controls such as dropdowns and buttons in order to increase
  information visibility and ease navigation.

## Data Center apps

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
