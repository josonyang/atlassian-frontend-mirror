## Usage

Tabs are an easy way to organize content by grouping similar information on the same page. People can view the content without having to navigate away from that page.

## Anatomy

1. **Selected:** The active tab text is darker and underlined.
2. **Unselected:** The other available tabs have text that is lighter.
3. **Divider:** A light visual line separates the tab navigation and content.

## Accessibility

- Keyboard users can navigate between tabs using the left and right arrow keys. The tab key is used to navigate to the tab content, not to the next tab. This is so that people who use screen readers don't have to tab through all of the tabs to read the content.
- Don't hide important information inside tabs, and keep the number of tabs low wherever possible.
- Don't nest interactive controls such as dropdowns and buttons inside tabs.

## Behavior

Tab behavior during standard, focus, hover, and active states are important because it lets people know where they are in the experience.

1. **Standard:** The default view.
2. **Focus:** Keyboard focus on a tab.
3. **Hover:** Hovering over a tab.
4. **Active:** Indicates the page that the user is viewing.

## Content guidelines

Tab labels provide clear and concise explanations of the content within. When using tabs, make sure that the content is broken down into categories that make sense and don't overlap. For example, in a series of instructions about setting up a mobile app, you could use "for iOS", and "for Android" tabs, but not "Part 1" and "Part 2" tabs.
