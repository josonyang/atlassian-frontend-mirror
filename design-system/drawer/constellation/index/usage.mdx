## Usage

The drawer component is a modal dialog that appears from the side of the screen. You can configure
the size of the drawer to be narrow, medium, wide, extended, or full.

Like standard modal dialogs, drawers are invasive and should be used sparingly.

Choose a drawer over a modal dialog if you need to help people complete a secondary task, while
keeping them on the same page they are working on.

## Accessibility

### Be aware of covered UI

When using extended or full size drawers, keep in mind that people may lose track of where they are
situated in their workflow, as there is lower visual affordance to show that they are in a modal.
Unless there are significant benefits to interrupting a task with a drawer modal, we recommend
choosing a new page experience or non-modal dialog instead.

When the drawer is open, keep in mind that the background content isn’t interactive or focusable, so
don’t present people with a task in a drawer if they need to reference the content in the UI behind
the drawer.

### Labeling drawer modals

Drawers must have a title or label so that people can understand what the drawer is for. You can do
this in one of two ways:

1. Add the titleId to an element within your drawer modal. This approach is best, because you can
   associate the accessible title with a visible heading.
2. Use the label prop when there isn’t a visual heading.

### Managing focus

When the drawer is opened, set focus to the first item in the drawer. When it's closed, set focus
back to the component that triggered it.

## Behavior

### Dismissing drawer modals

Users can't interact with the rest of the page until the modal is closed. These are the three
options that will dismiss a drawer:

- Press the close/back control for the drawer
- Press "escape" on a keyboard
- Click anywhere on the blanket

- For most applications, use a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog/examples) instead.
- For bigger tasks, consider making a non-modal dialog using
  [spacing tokens](/foundations/spacing/).
