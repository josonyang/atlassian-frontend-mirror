## Default

The default form of a drawer. Use either the `label` or `titleId` prop to announce the accessible name of the drawer to users of assistive technology.

<Example Component={DrawerDefaultExample} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" />

## Width

<DrawerWidthsDescription />

Use `medium` or `wide` for most applications. Use `extended` and `full` with caution, because there isnâ€™t enough visual affordance that this is a drawer and not a new page.

<Example Component={DrawerWidths} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" />

<!-- This feature does not work due to a bug DSP-3912. A note has been added to
this ticket to re-enable this example once fixed.

## Unmounting

The state of the drawer will be preserved by default. If you'd like to
clear the state when the drawer is closed use `shouldUnmountOnExit`.

<Example Component={DrawerUnmountExample} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" /> -->

## Surface detection

The [current surface CSS variable](/components/tokens/code#current-surface-color) is set to the surface color of the drawer.
You can use the `utility.elevation.surface.current` design token to style children with the current surface color.

<Example Component={DrawerSurfaceDetection} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" />
