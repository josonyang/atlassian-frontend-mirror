## Migration guide

The latest version of `@atlaskit/drawer` has been migrated from Emotion to Compiled CSS-in-JS. As
part of this migration, we have moved to a compositional API. This new compositional API will
replace `@atlaskit/drawer` in a future major version, but for now it's opt-in.

### Using the new compositional API

The new components are available via the `@atlaskit/drawer` entry point. There are three new
sub-components available:

- `DrawerContent`: Place the main content of the drawer inside this component.
- `DrawerSidebar`: The sidebar sits next to the main content and is designed to contain the close
  button.
- `DrawerCloseButton`: An icon button that closes the drawer.

#### Example migration diff

```diff
-import Drawer from '@atlaskit/drawer';
+import { Drawer, DrawerContent, DrawerCloseButton } from '@atlaskit/drawer';

export default MyDrawer = () => (
   <Drawer>
-    Hello world
+    <DrawerSidebar>
+      <DrawerCloseButton />
+    </DrawerSidebar>
+    <DrawerContent>Hello world</DrawerContent>
   </Drawer>
);
```

#### Basic usage

The default form of a drawer using the new compositional API.

<Example Component={DrawerDefaultExample} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" />

### Customization

Previously, customizing the drawer UI was handled via the overrides prop, which has now been
removed. Customization is now achieved via composition and the xcss prop.

#### Migrating `overrides.[sidebar|content].cssFn` prop

The legacy API allowed you to specify style overrides for the drawer sidebar and drawer content via
`cssFn` props. Safe style overrides can now be applied via `xcss` props on the `DrawerContent` and
`DrawerSidebar` components.

<Example Component={DrawerXcssExample} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" />

#### Migrating `overrides.[sidebar|content].component` prop

The legacy API allowed you to override the sidebar and content components, although it wasnâ€™t
recommended. Utilizing composition is the recommended migration path.

Below is an example of this; the Drawer components are composed with other elements/components to
produce a centered layout without a sidebar.

<Example Component={DrawerCustomCompositionExample} packageName="@atlaskit/drawer" />

### List of prop changes

With the compositional API, some props that were previously available on the Drawer component have
now been relocated to the sub-component that utilizes the value. Making it clearer which underlying
element the prop relates to.

| Legacy Drawer Prop   | Change in new API                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `icon`               | Moved to: `icon` prop on `DrawerCloseButton`                                    |
| `closeLabel`         | Moved to: `label` prop on `DrawerCloseButton`                                   |
| `scrollContentLabel` | Moved to: `scrollContentLabel` prop on `DrawerContent`                          |
| `overrides`          | Removed: Use `xcss` prop on `DrawerContent`/`DrawerSidebar` and/or composition. |
