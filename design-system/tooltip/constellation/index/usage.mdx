## Usage

Use tooltips to identify or add a small amount of information to an element. Typically, tooltips are used to:

- help users understand the meaning or purpose of icons
- show the full version of truncated text

Never put links or other interactable components in tooltips because this isn't accessible or usable. Tooltips should only include short informative text.

## Best practices

- Do not put essential information in a tooltip. Tooltips have low discoverability and have usability issues on devices without hover interactions.
- Tooltips should only appear when the user has paused on the target element. They should remain visible if the user briefly moves the mouse off and back on to the target.
- Tooltips should not immediately disappear, unless the user hovers over another element with a tooltip.
- When the user scrolls, their attention is no longer on the tooltip. We take this opportunity to immediately hide the tooltip.
- Never put a tooltip on a disabled button. This is inaccessible and unsupported.

## Behavior

Tooltips replace standard browser tooltips when more emphasis is required. Tooltips do not receive input focus.

The position of tooltips is flexible and will change depending on how close the element is to the edge of the screen.

## Content guidelines

When writing tooltips, be short and concise and follow the [writing guidelines](/content/writing-style).

## Server

Consult [AUI](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/tooltips.html) for implementation details.
