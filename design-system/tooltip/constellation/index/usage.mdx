## Usage

Use tooltips to add a small amount of information to an element. Use tooltips to:

- help people understand the meaning or purpose of icons.
- show non-essential supporting information.

## Accessibility

If you have space for it, then a solution that is visible on the page, like an
[inline message](/components/inline-message), will always be more accessible.

- Never put links or other interactive components in tooltips because this isn't accessible or
  usable. Tooltips should only include short informative text.
- Don't put essential information in a tooltip. Tooltips have low discoverability and have usability
  issues on devices without hover interactions.
- Never put a tooltip on a disabled button. This is inaccessible and unsupported.
- Avoid truncating tooltip text as people will not be able to visually read the message.

## Best practices

- Tooltips should only appear when the person has paused on the target element. It should remain
  visible if the person briefly moves the mouse off and back on to the target.
- Tooltips shouldn't immediately disappear, unless the person hovers or keyboard focuses on another
  element with a tooltip.
- When the person using the UI scrolls, their attention is no longer on the tooltip. We take this
  opportunity to immediately hide the tooltip.

## Behavior

Tooltips replace standard browser tooltips when more emphasis is required. Tooltips don't receive
input focus.

The position of tooltips is flexible and will change depending on how close the element is to the
edge of the screen.

## Content guidelines

Avoid repeating content inside a tooltip if there's already a visible label.

## Data Center products

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
