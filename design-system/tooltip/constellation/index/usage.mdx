## Usage

Use tooltips to identify or add a small amount of information to an element. Typically, tooltips are used to:

- help people understand the meaning or purpose of icons.
- show the full version of truncated text.

## Accessibility

- Never put links or other interactive components in tooltips because this isn't accessible or usable. Tooltips should only include short informative text.
- Don't put essential information in a tooltip. Tooltips have low discoverability and have usability issues on devices without hover interactions.
- Never put a tooltip on a disabled button. This is inaccessible and unsupported.
- Avoid truncating tooltip text as people will not be able to visually read the message.
- If you have space for it, then a solution that is visible on the page, like an [inline-message](/components/inline-message), will always be more accessible.

## Best practices

- Tooltips should only appear when the person has paused on the target element. They should remain visible if the person briefly moves the mouse off and back on to the target.
- Tooltips shouldn't immediately disappear, unless the person hovers or keyboard focuses on another element with a tooltip.
- When the person using the UI scrolls, their attention is no longer on the tooltip. We take this opportunity to immediately hide the tooltip.

## Behavior

Tooltips replace standard browser tooltips when more emphasis is required. Tooltips don't receive input focus.

The position of tooltips is flexible and will change depending on how close the element is to the edge of the screen.

## Content guidelines

When writing tooltips, be concise and follow the [writing guidelines](/content/writing-style).

Avoid repeating content inside a tooltip if there's already a visible label.

## Data Center products

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other [Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use [Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
