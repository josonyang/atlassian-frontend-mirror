## Layout

The full page layout with all areas rendered has the structure depicted below.

<PageLayoutDiagram />

When composing your page layout ensure that:

- The `Root` element wraps your entire view
- All layout areas are rendered as immediate children of the `Root` element

## Layout areas

These are the distinct areas in the navigation layout. These components are designed to contain
other components and content.

### Root

The root component of the navigation system, wrapping the entire view. It provides the React
contexts that power the layout.

### Banner

Use the `Banner` area to render a [banner component](/components/banner). It will always be
displayed at the top of the screen.

<Example Component={BannerLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

### TopNav

Use the `TopNav` to render [top nav items](/components/navigation-system/top-nav-items). It will
display at the top of the screen, below the banner if one is present.

<Example Component={TopNavLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

### Side nav

Use the `SideNav` area to render
[side navigation items](/components/navigation-system/side-navigation). It will show on the left of
the screen.

Use the [side nav area components](#side-nav-areas) to position content within areas of the side
nav.

You can optionally render a [panel splitter](#panel-splitter) as a child to make the side navigation
slot resizable.

<Example Component={SideNavLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

#### Programmatically toggling the side nav

There are two hooks available for toggling the side nav.

<SectionMessage title="Usage">
	These hooks need to be used by components that are rendered as a child of <a href="#root">Root</a>
	, as they require the internal React context that it provides.
</SectionMessage>

##### useExpandSideNav

Returns a function that will expand the side nav.

This can be useful for ensuring the side nav is expanded before displaying an onboarding spotlight,
for example. If the side nav is already expanded, it will simply no-op.

<Example Component={ExpandSideNavButtonExample} appearance="source-only" />

##### useToggleSideNav

Returns a function that will toggle the side nav.

This is useful for toggling the side nav based on a keyboard shortcut.

<Example Component={ToggleSideNavKeyboardShortcutExample} appearance="source-only" />

### Side nav areas

The side nav has three layout components that you can use to position components within the side nav
flexbox.

<Example Component={SideNavSlotsExample} appearance="source-only" />

#### SideNavHeader

The top part of the side nav.

#### SideNavContent

The middle part of the side nav. It acts as a scroll container.

It will grow to take up the available space in the side nav â€” this is used to push the footer to the
bottom of the side nav.

#### SideNavFooter

The bottom part of the side nav.

**Note:** make sure to render `SideNavContent` as well to ensure that the footer is positioned at
the bottom of the side nav, simulating a sticky footer.

### Side nav flyout

The `SideNav` has a flyout feature - where it will overlay on top of the main content when the user
hovers over the `SideNavToggleButton` in the top bar, if the side nav was collapsed.

- Hovering over the side nav will keep it in the flyout state.
- Hovering away from the side nav will collapse the flyout.
  - If there are any open supported ADS layering components (e.g. Popups, Dropdown menus) within the
    side nav, the flyout will stay locked open, until the layering components are closed.

The expansion and collapse of the side nav flyout is animated on **supported browsers**. Currently,
Firefox does not support the animation. Instead, it will instantly expand and collapse.

### Main

Use the `Main` area for the main page content. It has a fluid width and will expand to fill
available space.

<Example Component={MainLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

### Aside

The `Aside` is rendered to the right of the `Main` area.

You can optionally render a [panel splitter](#panel-splitter) as a child to make the aside area
resizable.

<Example Component={AsideLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

### Panel

The `Panel` is rendered to the right of the `Main` and `Aside` areas.

You can optionally render a [panel splitter](#panel-splitter) as a child to make the panel area
resizable.

<Example Component={PanelLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

## Resizable areas

Render `PanelSplitter` in a layout area to make it resizable.

Resizing is supported for the following areas:

- `SideNav`
- `Aside`
- `Panel`

<Example Component={PanelSplitterLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

## Advanced layouts

<SectionMessage appearance="warning" title="Use with caution">
	We recommend aligning with our standard page layout wherever possible. Advanced layouts require
	you to maintain additional complexity.
</SectionMessage>

Advanced layouts can be created inside of the [main area](#main).

<Example Component={AdvancedLayoutExample} appearance="source-only" />

### Custom skip links

Use `useSkipLink` to register custom skip links where appropriate.

The `useSkipLink` hook accepts an optional third argument to manually specify the index of the skip
link in the list.

You can also optionally use the `useSkipLinkId` hook to retrieve a unique ID for use for your skip
link.

<Example Component={CustomSkipLinkExample} appearance="source-only" />
