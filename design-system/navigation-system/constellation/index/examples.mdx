Navigation is how users get around a site to complete their tasks.

## Overview

Atlassianâ€™s navigation is made of these basic parts:

- The [layout](/components/navigation-system/layout) defines clear areas for navigation elements
- [Side navigation menus](/components/navigation-system/side-navigation) create a consistent feel
  for actions and links
- [Top navigation elements](/components/navigation-system/top-navigation) provide familiar spots for
  common features

These layout and menu areas contain the app switcher, search, and other key features in Atlassian
products.
