/**
 * The SSR safety tests are placed in a separate file to avoid conflicts with other tests.
 * For example, running in the same test suite as tests with `toPassStrictMode()` will cause the following error:
 * "Detected multiple renderers concurrently rendering the same context provider. This is currently unsupported."
 *
 * This appears to be because:
 * - `toPassStrictMode` test uses `jest.isolateModulesAsync` with `createRoot`
 * - `doesHydrateWithSsr` test uses `hydrateRoot`
 *
 * There might be a better solution for this, but placing them in separate test modules is a simple workaround
 * for now.
 *
 * Alternative solutions that also appear to "fix" the issue, but are not ideal:
 * - Removing `jest.isolateModulesAsync` from `toPassStrictMode` test
 * - Moving `const { render } = require('./harness');` out of the isolated callback in `toPassStrictMode`, and importing it in the module
 * - Using `hydrateRoot` in `toPassStrictMode` test instead of `createRoot`
