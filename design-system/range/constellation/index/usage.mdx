## Usage

Use ranges in [forms](/patterns/forms) to let people select a value within a given range of minimum
and maximum values.

## Anatomy

1. **Track:** The track is a horizontal line that displays the range available for the user to
   select from.
2. **Handle:** A circular position indicator that people can move along the track to change the
   value.

## Accessibility

- Don't use a range if choosing a specific value is important. The slider interaction isn't as
  precise as explicitly typing or choosing an option from a list.
- Don't use a range for values that aren't numeric. For example, selecting weekdays (Monday to
  Friday).

## Best practices

- Place labels directly above the input, and align to the left.
- Don't use for ranges that are extremely large. For example, values over 100.
- Don't use for ranges that are very small (for example, 1-3). The range moves in steps when the
  range of values is lower.
- For left-to-right user interfaces, put the lowest value on the left of the slider. For
  right-to-left user interfaces, put the lowest value on the right.

## Content guidelines

- Keep labels short and concise.
- If necessary, use helper text to clarify how to use the range.
