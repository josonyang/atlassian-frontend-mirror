## Usage

Breadcrumbs are an alternative way to help users orient themselves. They're a useful addition to,
but shouldn’t replace, the main navigation on a page.

Use breadcrumbs for nested navigation, with each item acting as a link. They show the hierarchical
progress from the highest item level to the lowest, one step at a time. This typically starts with
the product landing page and goes to the current page or content.

## Anatomy

1. **Item name:** The section or page within the product, usually a link.
2. **Separator:** The separator is positioned between each item in the list. It provides visual
   distinction between individual links using the same font as the rest of the breadcrumbs. Usually
   a forward slash symbol `/`.
3. **Icon or avatar (optional):** Some links may have an icon or avatar before or after the
   corresponding page title.

## Accessibility

- Separators should have the same level of color contrast as the surrounding text.
- Separator characters should not be announced by screen readers.
- When additional breadcrumbs are collapsed into an ellipses, this is treated as a single list item
  for assistive technologies. The default label is ‘Show more breadcrumbs’.
- Use `isNavigation={false}` for any instances of breadcrumbs that aren't used for main navigation
  areas, like a listing of search results, to reduce noise for users of assistive technologies.
- Make sure your breadcrumb items reflect the page or product section titles exactly for screen
  readers.

## Best practices

- Use breadcrumbs when the user is most likely to have landed on the page from an external source.
- Use for large websites and complex products that have hierarchically arranged pages, so that users
  who land on the page can quickly know where they are.
- In products, breadcrumbs can adapt to the state of navigation by being toggled on, off, or
  auto-collapsing.
- Make sure breadcrumbs don’t visually overwhelm the page.
- Place breadcrumbs at the top left corner of the screen, above the page title.
- In product, avoid using the topmost level of the hierarchy unless the navigation sidebar is
  collapsed.
