## Usage

Use a progress indicator to help people keep track of their progress as they step through a task.

This component is typically accompanied by a carousel or another UI device.

## Anatomy

1. **Current progress:** A visual indicator that shows the current step in the journey.
2. **Steps:** A visual indicator that shows all the steps in the sequence.

## Accessibility

- Always provide an `ariaLabel` that explains what the indicator represents. For example, "Account setup". The progress number will be appended to the label.
- If interaction is enabled, use the `ariaControls` prop to tell assistive technology what elements are controlled by the progress indicator. For example, if interacting with the progress indicator changes tabs, specify this with `ariaControls`.
- Once an interactive progress indicator is in focus, people can navigate through each step using the left and right arrow keys.

## Best practices

Keep the task concise. Use a maximum of seven steps in your journey so that people aren't overwhelmed.

## Data Center products

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other [Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use [Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
