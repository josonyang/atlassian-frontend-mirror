## Usage

Use a progress indicator to help people keep track of their progress as they step through a task.

This component is typically accompanied by a carousel or another UI device.

## Anatomy

![The example progress indicator is a row of circles. The circle representing the current step in the journey is filled. The other circles are empty.](images/progress-indicator-anatomy.png)

1. **Current progress:** A visual indicator that shows the current step in the journey.
2. **Steps:** A visual indicator that shows all the steps in the sequence.

## Accessibility

- Always provide an `ariaLabel` that explains what the indicator represents. For example, "Account
  setup". The progress number will be appended to the label - "tab" is the default tab ID prefix
  value.
- If interaction is enabled, make sure to reference the `id` of associated tabpanel using the
  `ariaControls` prop. This way assistive technologies would identify the element whose content is
  controlled by the progress indicator.
- Once an interactive progress indicator is in focus, people can navigate through each step using
  the left and right arrow keys.

## Best practices

Keep the task concise. Use a maximum of seven steps in your journey so that people aren't
overwhelmed.

## Data Center apps

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
