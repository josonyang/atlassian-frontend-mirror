## Migration from ADG3

<Example Component={HeadingMigration} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />

### Context on ADG3 and ADG4

The Atlassian Design Guidelines 3 (ADG3) were the previous version of Atlassian's design guidelines.
These guidelines were built on top of the Atlassian User Interface (AUI) library.
ADG4 is a significant evolution of the guidelines and is not backwards compatible with ADG3.
If you are migrating from ADG3 to ADG4, you will need to update your code to use the new ADG4 components and APIs.
For now this migration is opt-in.

### `level` renamed to `variant`

The `level` prop on the `Heading` component has been renamed to `variant` to better reflect its purpose.
The `level` prop is still supported but will be removed in a future major release.

To migrate from `level` to `variant`, rename the `prop` in your code and update the value to match the new `variant` values.

```diff
- <Heading level="h300">
+ <Heading variant="xxs">
```

This migration isn't 1:1 as the `variant` prop has a different set of values to the `level` prop although there are
rough equivalents. Apply this migration carefully. Certain headings (h100, h200) have no equivalanece in the ADG4 typography system.

Other props on the `Heading` component have not changed.

### `token` backed components

The `variant` prop will only apply when a typography `theme` is on the page. Apply a typography theme via
the `setGlobalTheme()` function to enable the `variant` prop.
