## Usage

Use headings to create section and subsection titles on a page.

## Accessibility

Nest headings by their rank (or level). 

The most important heading has the rank 1 (`<h1>`), the least important heading rank 6 (`<h6>`). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher ranked section. There should **only be one rank 1 (`<h1>`) heading per page** consisting of the name or main purpose of the overall site/platform.

Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: make sure that a `<h2>` is **not** followed directly by an `<h4>`, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, a `<h2>` beginning a new section, can follow an `<h4>` as it closes the previous section.
