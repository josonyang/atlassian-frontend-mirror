## Basic

Implements the [Atlassian typography heading set](/foundations/typography/) as a component.

Depending on if you're applying the legacy or new system the API is slightly different. For the future typography system,
the `variant` prop is exposed to control the visual appearance of the heading element. For the legacy typography system,
use the `level` prop.

The `variant` and `level` can be configured to one of the following types.

<Example Component={HeadingDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />

## Inverse

Set `color` to change the text color of the heading. Use `color="inverse"` for headings placed on a dark
surface for better color contrast.

<Example Component={HeadingInverse} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />

## Heading Provider

The `HeadingContextProvider` component allows you to configure the default heading level for all headings.
By nesting a `HeadingContextProvider`, you can override the default heading level for a subtree. This is useful
for when you want to use a different heading level for a section of your page but do not have control over where
in the heading heirarchy that section will be placed.

<Example Component={HeadingProvider} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />
