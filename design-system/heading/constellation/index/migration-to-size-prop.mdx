## Migrating to new Heading API

As part of our new typography system, we've updated Heading to provide an API more consistent with other Design System components.
The primary change is replacing the `level` prop with `size` and updating the values to reference t-shirt sizes.

<Example Component={HeadingMigration} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />

### `level` renamed to `size`

The `level` prop on the `Heading` component has been renamed to `size` to better reflect its purpose.
The `level` prop is still supported but is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.

To migrate from `level` to `size`, rename the `prop` in your code and update the value to match the new `size` values referenced in the example above.

```diff
- <Heading level="h300">
+ <Heading size="xxsmall">
```

This migration isn't 1:1 as the `size` prop has a different set of values to the `level` prop, although equivalents exist for most levels.

Certain headings (h100, h300) have no direct equivalents in the new typography system.
For these, assess whether the text should still be a heading and if so, use the `xxsmall` size.

The removal of the all caps style from h300 and lighter colors from h100 and h200 is intentional for accessibility reasons.

Other props on the `Heading` component have not changed.
