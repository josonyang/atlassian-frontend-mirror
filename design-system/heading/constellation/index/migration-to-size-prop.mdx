## Migration from ADG3

As part of our new typography system, we've updated Heading to provide an API more consistent with other Design System components.
The primary change is replacing the `level` prop with `size` and updating the values to reference t-shirt sizes.

<Example Component={HeadingMigration} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />

### Context on ADG3 and the new system

The Atlassian Design Guidelines 3 (ADG3) were the previous version of Atlassian's design guidelines.
These guidelines were built on top of the Atlassian User Interface (AUI) library.

The new system is a significant evolution of the guidelines and is not backwards compatible with ADG3.
If you are migrating from ADG3, you will need to update your code to use the new components and APIs.
For now this migration is opt-in.

### `level` renamed to `size`

The `level` prop on the `Heading` component has been renamed to `size` to better reflect its purpose.
The `level` prop is still supported but is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.

To migrate from `level` to `size`, rename the `prop` in your code and update the value to match the new `size` values referenced in the example above.

```diff
- <Heading level="h300">
+ <Heading size="xxsmall">
```

This migration isn't 1:1 as the `size` prop has a different set of values to the `level` prop although there are
rough equivalents. Certain headings (h100, h200) have no equivalants in the new typography system. For these, assess whether the text should still be a Heading and if so, use the `xxsmall` size.

Other props on the `Heading` component have not changed.
