## Usage

An avatar represents a user or entity (such as a project, a repository, or a space), in a product. They're often combined with status or presence indicators to give more context. Users generally upload their own image. If they haven't uploaded an image, the avatar will use a default image.

Check you’re using the right avatar shape, size, and features for your use case:

- Use circular avatars to identify users.
- Use square avatars to identify large product entities like projects, spaces, groups, rooms, or repositories.
- Add a presence indicator to show a user's online availability. For example: available, away, focused, or busy.
- Add a status icon to show additional contextual information about the user. For example: an approved checkmark, to signal when a user has approved a piece of work.
- For more on sizing, see the [avatar sizing examples](/components/avatar/examples#size).

## Anatomy

The avatar component is made of three parts: Body, status, and presence.

1. **Body:** The image representing the user or entity. This can be round or square.
2. **Status:** An icon that displays the avatar’s status. This is positioned at the top right of the avatar component.
3. **Presence:** Indicates if a user is available, away, focused, or busy. This is positioned at the bottom left of the avatar component.

## Accessibility

- Use the `name` prop to include alternative text for screen readers.
- Don't use a [tooltip with an avatar](examples#displaying-a-tooltip) when it's non-interactive or disabled. The tooltip won't work for keyboard users and screen readers.
