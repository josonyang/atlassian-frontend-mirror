The `AvatarContent` component allows you to create avatars with custom content, such as text or
icons. It is used as a child of the `Avatar` component and can also be composed with other elements.

When using `AvatarContent`, the props from the `Avatar` component still apply. For example, you can
use the `size` prop to set the size of the avatar.

<Example Component={CustomAvatarExample} packageName="@atlaskit/avatar" />
