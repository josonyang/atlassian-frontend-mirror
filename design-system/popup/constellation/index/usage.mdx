## Usage

Use the popup component to display a brief message in an overlay.

While you can use popups to build compact interactive experiences like a menu, if it's intended to help someone complete a small task, use a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog) instead.

## Accessibility

- Don’t make popups that scroll. There isn't enough visual affordance to show that there's hidden content.
- Avoid nesting popups wherever possible.
- Use `role` to indicate what type of interactive element the popup is going to be. Usually the popup will be a `menu` or `dialog`. When the popup is used as a dialog, make sure it has a `label` or `titleId` that gives the dialog an accessible name.

## Behavior

The popup can be opened using the enter key, and dismissed with the escape key.

The popup is always dismissed when the user clicks outside of the popup area. Avoid putting required fields inside popups in case the popup is dismissed on click.

### Popup placement

- Use the placement prop to set your preferred position (`auto`, `top`, `right`, `left`, or `bottom`). The popup will move automatically if it's near the edge of the screen.
- Using the `auto` placement will put the popup on the side with the most space available.
- If you provide `fallbackPlacements`, the popup will use backup positions when your preferred position isn’t available.

- For interactive overlays, use the [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog) component.
- For non-essential, non-interactive messages, use the [tooltip](/components/tooltip/) component.
