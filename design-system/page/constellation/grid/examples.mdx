## Layout

Grids can have either a fixed or fluid layout, which determines its width.

### Fixed layout (default)

A fixed layout will occupy a maximum of 80px for each column space, plus a fixed amount based on the
chosen spacing.

<Example Component={GridFixedLayout} packageName="@atlaskit/page" />

### Fluid layout (custom width)

Custom width pages are supported by setting `layout="fluid"` on the Grid. This will make the grid
expand to fill its container.

<Example Component={GridFluidLayout} packageName="@atlaskit/page" />

## Spacing

The spacing between a grid's columns is configurable. There are three options available:

- `cosy` (default) adds a medium amount of spacing between columns (16px),
- `compact` adds a small amount of spacing (4px),
- `comfortable` adds a large amount of spacing (40px).

<Example Component={GridSpacing} packageName="@atlaskit/page" />

## Nesting

Grids can be nested inside of each other to form complex layouts.

If a nested `Grid` is inside of a `GridColumn` with a provided value for `medium`, then the nested
`Grid` will use that `medium` value as its default number of columns.

<Example Component={GridNested} packageName="@atlaskit/page" />
