# Codemod CLI

Detailed docs and example usage can be found [here](../../../repo-docs/content/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/atlassian-codemods.md)

## Testing locally

When wanting to run the CLI before it has been published you can run the start command.

```
yarn start [commands]
```

For a list of commands run it with `-h` or look at the [documentation](../../../repo-docs/content/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/atlassian-codemods.md).
