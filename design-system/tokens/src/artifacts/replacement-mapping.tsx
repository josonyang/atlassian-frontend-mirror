/**
 * THIS FILE WAS CREATED VIA CODEGEN DO NOT MODIFY {@see http://go/af-codegen}
 *
 * This file is intended to help automate renaming of tokens.
 *
 * 1. Mark the old token's 'state' as deprecated
 * 2. Add a 'replacement' attribute to the token with the value 'my.new.token'
 * 3. Create a new token matching the token above: 'my.new.token'
 * 4. Run 'yarn build tokens' to have you changes reflected in this map
 * 5. ESLint and other tools will now use this to automate replacing tokens
 *
 * These changes will then be picked up by our tooling which will attempt to
 * migrate as many of these renames as possible.
 *
 * @codegen <<SignedSource::424b7eccf34d7d646da64d4755658ae1>>
 * @codegenCommand yarn build tokens
