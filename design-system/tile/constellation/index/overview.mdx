## Tile system

The tile component sets the foundation of our tile system, setting a standard for size, space, and
shape properties for all tile-shaped elements within Atlassian UI.

So far, the properties of tile is inherited by the following components:

- Icon tile
- Object tile

Makers should default to using these components, but in cases where a 'custom' tile is needed (for
assets such as third-party logos or emojis), the tile component can be leveraged.

Together, these components make a comprehensive system that brings flexibility and consistency to
our apps.

				<a href="/components/tile/examples">Tile</a>
			</Cell>
			<Cell>
				A versatile, foundational container with baked-in sizing and radii properties for displaying
				elements in a tile shape. It is flexible and can be used as a container to add in any
				foreground element, background, or color as needed.
			</Cell>
			<Cell>Anything that's not an icon or object, such as emojis and third-party logos</Cell>
		</Row>
		<Row key={2}>
			<Cell width="18%">
				<a href="/components/icon/icon-tile/examples">Icon tile</a>
			</Cell>
			<Cell>
				Allows icons to be scaled larger than 16px. It has pre-set options for color and size to
				ensure accessibility and readability, and to prominently highlight icons in a layout.
			</Cell>
			<Cell>Icons</Cell>
		</Row>
		<Row key={3}>
			<Cell width="18%">
				<a href="/components/object/object-tile/examples">Object tile</a>
			</Cell>
			<Cell>
				Use instead of an icon tile to represent Atlassian-specific content icons, such as pages,
				live docs, whiteboard, or bugs. Each object tile has a specific color token that cannot be
				changed.
			</Cell>
			<Cell>Objects</Cell>
