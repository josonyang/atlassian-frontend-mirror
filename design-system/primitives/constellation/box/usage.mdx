A `Box` is a generic container with convenient and managed access to design tokens, and built-in guidance for the best practices of the Atlassian Design System.
Use a `Box` to compose layouts and add styling to child elements through visual props, including spacing and color through design tokens.

## `Box` styling
Display behavior is set by using the available props or using `xcss`. Makers can make design decisions for `Box` by setting:

- `padding`
- `paddingInline`
- `paddingInlineStart`
- `paddingInlineEnd`
- `paddingBlock`
- `paddingBlockStart`
- `paddingBlockEnd`
- `backgroundColor`

## Using `Box`
To identify usages of `Box` in a given design, look for where a UI element will receive some visual styles applied to a container. `Box` can be used on a range of sizes of elements, from buttons to section wrappers.
`Box`, being generic in nature, can be "over-used", so itâ€™s important to consider situations where more specific and expressive primitives could be used, for example: `Inline` and `Stack` to manage horizontal and vertical layouts, respectively.
