Use box to compose layouts with the valid spacing and background colors. A `Box` is a generic container with convenient and managed access to design tokens, and built-in guidance for the best practices of the Atlassian Design System.

A `Box` is primarily a containment element, with visual props that affect the whitespace available to child elements. 


## Use `Box`
Display behavior is set by using the available props or using `xcss`. Makers can make design decisions for `Box` by setting:

- `padding`
- `paddingInline`
- `paddingInlineStart`
- `paddingInlineEnd`
- `paddingBlock`
- `paddingBlockStart`
- `paddingBlockEnd`
- `backgroundColor`

To identify usages of `Box` in a given design, look for where a UI element (could be as small as the parent of a button or as a big as the wrapper of an entire section) will receive some visual styles applied to a container.

`Box`, being generic in nature, can be "over-used", so itâ€™s important to consider situations where more specific and expressive primitives could be used, for example: `Inline` and `Stack` to manage horizontal and vertical layouts, respectively.
