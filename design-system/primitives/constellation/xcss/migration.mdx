## Summary of changes

### Changes for developers

There are two key changes to be mindful of when migrating to use `xcss`.
The first is needing to update callsites to remove any nested styles and
tokenised values.

```diff
- import { css } from '@emotion/react';
+ import { xcss } from '@atlaskit/primitives';

- const someStyles = css({
+ const someStyles = xcss({
  // token based properties will no longer need to be wrapped
- padding: token('space.100'),
+ padding: 'space.100'
  // no change is required for non-tokenised values
  transform: 'scale(2)'
});
```

The second is that for the `xcss` function to be applied correctly it must be applied on a
component with an `xcss` JSXAttribute. By default this won't work with the `css` or `className`
JSXAttributes - so be aware if you're not seeing your styles appear.

```diff
- <div css={someStyles} />
+ <Box xcss={someStyles} />
```


#### Changing the way you express styles

Why are nested selectors a problem? A key philosophy of `xcss` is encouraging more deterministic style application. This restriction is designed to eliminate side-effects and
encourage component encapsulation. Consider the below example:

```tsx
const myComponentStyles = css({
  '> *': {
    color: 'color.text.danger',
  }
});

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div css={myComponentStyles}>
    <p>Text here</p>
  </div>
);
```

Here the component is applying styles that are implicity meant for the text wrapped in the `p` below.
In this simple example, it may seem okay, desirable even, but cases like these often occur across module or component boundaries.

This makes the visibility of these dependencies harder to capture or reason about.
Styles that are inherited or indirectly apply make a UI brittle to change and hard to evolve.
Instead, if the same styles are applied directly on the affected element we can minimize and in some cases completely eliminate this problem.

```diff
const myTextStyles = xcss({
-  '> *': {
   color: 'color.text.danger',
-  }
});

const MyComponent = () => (
-  <div xcss={myComponentStyles}>
+  <Box
+    <Text xcss={myTextStyles}>Text here</Text>
   </Box>
);
```

There are likely to be cases where nesting is the only option. While not desirable, this is fine as long as it's considered
a last resort.

### FAQ

Overall migration to `xcss` is fairly simple for the majority of cases. Here are some common strategies for migrations.

#### Non-tokenised values

If you're yet to migrate to tokens, you have two options. You can migrate to tokens first and then on a second pass
migrate to `xcss` or you can make the jump directly.

```tsx
const someStyles = css({
  color: 'red',
});

// ->>> Optional middle step
const someStyles = css({
  color: token('color.text.danger'),
});

// ->>> The final state
const someStyles = xcss({
  color: 'color.text.danger',
});
```

#### Moving from the `styled` API

If you're currently using the `styled` API there are a few steps required to migration.
The safest approach is to a step change to use object styles, migrate to tokens (optionally)
and then migrate to `xcss`.

```tsx
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  color: red;
`;

// ->>> move to object styles
const MyComponent = styled.div({
  color: 'red';
});

// ->>> move to tokens
const MyComponent = styled.div({
  color: token('color.text.danger'),
});

// ->>> move to Box
const myComponentStyles = xcss({
  color: 'color.text.danger',
});

const MyComponent = () => <Box xcss={myComponentStyles} />
```
