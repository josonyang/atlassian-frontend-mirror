`xcss` is an Atlassian Design System styling API designed to natively integrate with
Atlassian's [design tokens](/tokens) and [primitives](/components/primitives) in a safer, more resilient and evolvable way.

The `xcss` utility behaves similarly to the `css` utility in libraries
like `styled-components`, `@compiled` or `@emotion` - so if you've used those libraries before
it will feel very familiar, with a few additional features and some constraints.

Features that will feel familiar:

* `xcss` will generate a `className` to be applied on your components
* `xcss` will provide key-value pairs of CSS properties in an object format
* `xcss` supports style precedence and conditional styles

But it also has a few key differences.

* `xcss` has type-safety that uses token names for all CSS properties that are represented by design tokens.
* `xcss` restricts nested selectors completely from usage.

## Usage

To get started, import the function from `@atlaskit/primitives` and create a style:

```tsx
import { xcss } from '@atlaskit/primitives';

// Creates a basic style
const someStyles = xcss({
  display: 'block',
});
```

Apply this style to a component through the `xcss` prop:

```tsx
import { Box, xcss } from '@atlaskit/primitives';

// Creates a basic style
const someStyles = xcss({
  display: 'block',
});

const MyBox = () => {
  return <Box xcss={someStyles} />
}
```

The prop and the `xcss` function are direct complements and are meant
to be used together. Note: styles generated from `xcss` cannot be applied directly
to the `className` property or `css` as they are with other CSS-in-JS libraries.

### Type safety

`xcss` uses strongly-typed values generated from design token
definitions to make it simpler to apply the right token for the right CSS property.
This is intended to be more ergonomic and intuitive but also prevent the misapplication of tokens
to the wrong properties.

Any [valid token name](/components/tokens/all-tokens) is available to be applied against its
matching CSS property. For example, the token name `space.200`
is a valid value below for `padding` but will not appear
as a color, or a font.

```tsx
import { xcss } from '@atlaskit/primitives';

const someStyles = xcss({
  padding: 'space.200', // <--- works
  color: 'space.200',   // <--- invalid and will error
  borderRadius: 'border.radius.100' // <--- also valid
});
```

### Restricted nesting

`xcss` is meant to be flexible enough for you to implement any design but it does
restrict the application of styles in one key way. Selectors cannot be
nested or target elements beyond the element on which styles are applied.
This restriction is intended to encourage better component encapsulation, reduce side-effects and make
your codebase more resilient to change.

```tsx
import { xcss } from '@atlaskit/primitives';

const someStyles = xcss({
  ':hover': {
    transform: 'scale(1)' // this is okay
  },
  // This is not okay as this selector affects any nested div in
  // the component tree.
  'div:hover': {
    transform: 'scale(1)'
  },
  // Neither is this
  '> * > div:hover': {
    transform: 'scale(1)'
  },
});
```

These unsafe selectors will throw a type error if applied.
