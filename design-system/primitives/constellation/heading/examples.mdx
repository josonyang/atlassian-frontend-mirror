## Basic

Implements the [Atlassian typography set](/foundations/typography/) as a component.

A selected `level` will affect the final HTML element rendered in the DOM.
It's important to note that the final DOM may be impacted by the parent heading level context
because of inferred accessibility level correction. Therefore, it is recommended to check the final
DOM to confirm the actual rendered HTML element.

The typography `level` can be configured to one of the following types.

<Example Component={HeadingDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />

## Inverse

Set `color` to change the text color of the heading. Use `color="inverse"` for headings placed on a dark
surface for better color contrast.

<Example Component={HeadingInverse} packageName="@atlaskit/heading" />
