## Responsive `css` or `xcss`

Utilize our media queries exposed in `css`, `styled`, or `xcss` as computed keys to build responsive UIs. Learn more about these media query exports in [usage](/components/primitives/responsive/usage).

### Using with `xcss`

Please use `xcss` whenever possible to ensure consistency and safety with style overrides.  Read more at [xcss](/components/primitives/xcss)

### Using with `css`

## Responsive primitives

Consider these shortcuts to writing your own custom media queries.  Composing with our primitives will be far quicker and consistent to implement, but may result in excess DOM nodes.

### Show

This allows you to Show the children using CSS `display: …` either above or below a breakpoint.  By default, unless the breakpoint is met, contents are hidden.

Note that this does not skip rendering of your children; the contents are rendered into the DOM at all times, so there is typically little performance savings—primarily that this is not painted.

<Example Component={ShowExample} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/responsive" />

### Hide

This allows you to Hide the children using CSS `display: none` either above or below a breakpoint.  By default, unless the breakpoint is met, contents are hidden.

When hidden, this does not skip rendering of your children; the contents are rendered into the DOM at all times so there is typically little performance savings—primarily that this is not painted.

### Mixing Show and Hide

Prefer using consistent `above` or `below` for readability and consistency.
