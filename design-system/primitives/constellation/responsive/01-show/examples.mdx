### Show

This allows you to Show the children using CSS `display: …` either above or below a breakpoint.  By default, unless the breakpoint is met, contents are hidden.

Note that this does not skip rendering of your children; the contents are rendered into the DOM at all times, so there is typically little performance savings—primarily that this is not painted.

### Mixing Show and Hide

Prefer using consistent `above` or `below` for readability and consistency.

<Example Component={ShowHideExample} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/responsive" />
