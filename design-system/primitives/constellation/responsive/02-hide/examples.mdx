### Hide

This allows you to Hide the children using CSS `display: none` either above or below a breakpoint.  By default, unless the breakpoint is met, contents are hidden.

When hidden, this does not skip rendering of your children; the contents are rendered into the DOM at all times so there is typically little performance savingsâ€”primarily that this is not painted.

### Mixing Show and Hide

Prefer using consistent `above` or `below` for readability and consistency.
