Anchor is a primitive used for building custom links with Atlassian Design System styling, routing support, and built-in event tracking. Ultimately it renders an anchor `<a>` element.

Only use anchor when existing components such as [link](/components/link/examples) or [link button](/components/button/link-button/examples) are unsuitable and unable to be customized to fit your needs.

## Default

Anchor is unstyled besides a default underline. If you are using the [CSS reset](/components/css-reset/examples), it will also inherit some global styles.

<Example Component={AnchorDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor" />

## Basic styling with XCSS

Anchor can be styled using XCSS. It includes consistent Atlassian Design System `:focus` styles, so it's unnecessary to add your own.

For more information on XCSS, see the [XCSS documentation](/components/primitives/xcss).

<Example Component={AnchorBasic} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor" />

## Advanced styling

Use a combination of XCSS and other primitives for more complex designs.

<Example Component={AnchorStyled} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor" />

## HTML attributes

Anchor passes through all valid HTML attributes to the underlying `<a>` element.

<Example
  Component={AnchorHtmlAttributes}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor"
/>

## Router links

Routing libraries often supply their own link components enhanced with routing support. This can be configured in the [AppProvider context](/components/app-provider/examples#router-links), and anchor will automatically use it.

This example shows a configuration for [React Resource Router](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/react-resource-router), however any routing library can be used.

Using this method, anchor accepts `href` as a string for standard usage. For advanced usage, an object can be passed.

Anchor will only render a router link if:

- a link component is set in the app provider
- it's not an external link (starting with `http://` or `https://`)
- it's not a non-HTTP-based link (e.g. emails, phone numbers, hash links etc.).

<Example
  Component={AnchorRouterLinkConfiguration}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor"
  appearance="source-only"
/>

## Event tracking

Anchor has utilities to make tracking events easier. Events will not be captured unless listeners are setup to handle them.

### Track events for any analytics provider

Anchor comes with built-in Atlaskit analytics support using the [Analytics next package](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/analytics/analytics-next), and fires events for available listeners. Currently this is only available for `onClick`.

It always fires events on the `atlaskit` channel. To also fire events on other channels, use the provided `analyticsEvent` in `onClick`. To configure event data, use `componentName` (defaults to 'Anchor') and `analyticsContext` for passing other metadata.

See the event data in the console.

<Example
  Component={AnchorAnalytics}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor"
/>

### Track events for Atlassian internal services

#### GASv3 analytics

The Atlassian analytics bridge makes Atlaskit analytics events compatible with GASv3 (Global Analytics Service). This can also inject an `actionSubjectId` to the event if required.

See the event data in the console.

<Example
  Component={AnchorAnalyticsGASv3}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor"
/>

#### React UFO press interactions

By default, anchor fires [React UFO (Unified Frontend Observability) press interactions](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/ufo/react-ufo/react-ufo/getting-started/#quick-start--press-interactions) for available listeners. This helps Atlassian measure performance and reliability. Additional detail can be provided using the `interactionName` prop.

<Example
  Component={AnchorPressTracing}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/anchor"
/>
