Primitive components act as building blocks for composing a user experience. Use the inline primitive to lay out UI elements horizontally using built-in design guidance from the Atlassian Design System.

Inline primitives work as you might expect, aligning content horizontally across a page or layout, as a container that decides the horizontal layout of its children. Inline components also decide the specifics of how the children are displayed, for example, where they are aligned or how much space is between child elements. Inline should be used purely for visual alignment, and should have no opinions about the functionality of its children.

In its simplest form, `Inline` operates like a flexbox row, however adds the built in design token support and guidance.

```jsx
<Inline space="space.100" alignInline="center" alignBlock="start">
  ...
</Inline>
```

Inline also has a `flex-direction: row;`. This is the default for flexbox, so it is not explicitly applied.

## Use inline

The purpose of an Inline is primarily as a container element controlling how child components are displayed and positioned horizontally. Inline should be used any time you wish to layout elements or components horizontally.

The inline props can then be used to customize the spacing and styling on any child elements. These include:

- `alignBlock`
- `alignInline`
- `shouldWrap`
- `spread`
- `grow`
- `space`
- `rowSpace`
- `separator`
