## Usage

Use tags to label UI objects for quick recognition and navigation. They can be used for various
types of objects, including: free form text, predefined text, rules, or contacts.

Tags are designed to be displayed within a [tag group](/components/tag-group). They can be rendered
flat, as links, or with a close button.

## Best practices

- Keep in mind that tags increase the amount of cognitive noise, particularly when combined with
  other labelling elements, so use them in moderation.
- Custom color tags can be used to organize a large amount of content. For example, using epic tags
  for organizing work in a Jira backlog.

## Behavior

### Removing tags

Tags can be permanent or removable (by displaying the remove icon). When a tag is removed, the tags
will realign towards their direction of alignment (aligned to the start or end).

**Align to the start:**

**Align to the end:**

## Content guidelines

- When writing tags, avoid line wrapping, and follow the
  [writing guidelines](/content/writing-style).
- If the tag content isn't user generated, keep labels short to avoid truncation.
