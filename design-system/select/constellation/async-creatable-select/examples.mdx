import SelectAsyncCreatable from '../../examples/constellation/select-async-creatable';

Async creatable select introduces a `loadOptions` prop that can be given a promise or callback that will eventually resolve to its list of options.

It also introduces the `onCreateOption` prop that you can use to let people create new options that are not yet available.
