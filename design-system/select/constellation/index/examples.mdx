## Async select

Select now supports to handle loading data from remote sources by default, please use `loadOptions`
prop that can be given a promise or callback that will eventually resolve to its list of options
instead of `options`.

<Example Component={SelectAsync} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Single select

Allows the user to select a single item from a dropdown list of options.

<Example Component={SelectSingle} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Single select clearable

Setting `isClearable` to true lets users clear their selection using the Backspace or Delete key.

<Example Component={SelectSingleClearable} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Multi select

Allows the user to select multiple items from a dropdown list of options.

<Example Component={SelectMulti} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Grouped options

Related options can be grouped together in both a single and multi select.

<Example Component={SelectGroupedOptions} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Appearance

### Default

The default select appearance.

<Example Component={SelectAppearanceDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

### Subtle

A select that's transparent until interaction or error.

<Example Component={SelectAppearanceSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Style customization

The Select component provides flexible styling options to customize its appearance and behavior.
With the migration to Compiled CSS, we now offer enhanced styling capabilities through the
`components` API with `xcss` prop support.

### Recommended: Components API with xcss

The preferred method for customizing Select styles is using the `components` API with the xcss prop.
This approach provides type-safe, performant styling with Compiled CSS-in-JS.

<Example Component={SelectControlStyleOverride} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

### Legacy: Styles Prop (Limited Support)

The `styles` prop is still supported for backward compatibility, but has limitations with certain
CSS selectors.

<Example Component={SelectControlStyleOverrideLegacy} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

## Component customization

The following components are customizable and switchable:

### Clear indicator

The indicator is presented to clear the values from a multi-select. The default component is a
cross. The indicator will not render when:

1. `isClearable` is false, or `isMulti` is false and `isClearable` is undefined
2. the select is disabled
3. the select has no value
4. the select is loading

The clear control has been intentionally removed from the tab order. It can confuse people across
multiple disability cohorts and be cumbersome for sighted people who use keyboards.

Instead, the clear control is optimized for pointer interactions, like mouse click or tap. And
people using a keyboard will use the `DELETE` key to clear contents and `CTRL+A` to select all.

<Example Component={SelectIndicatorsClear} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

### Dropdown indicator

The indicator for opening the `Select` is designed to indicate to users that this is a `Select`
component. By default, it is a chevron pointed down, but in this example we have replaced it with an
emoji.

<Example Component={SelectIndicatorsDropdown} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />

### Loading indicator

Loading indicator to be displayed in the Indicators Container when isLoading is true.

<Example Component={SelectIndicatorsLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/select" />
