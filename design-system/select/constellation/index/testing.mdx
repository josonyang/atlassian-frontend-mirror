## Testing with `testId`

As of version 18.10.4, Select now supports specifying a `testId` for testing. These should be used
going forward as the preferred method over the previously recommended `className` or
`classNamePrefix` as these may be deprecated in the future.

Here are new values you can use as locators:

| classeNamePrefix                        | testId                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `[classNamePrefix]__control`            | `${testId}-select--control`              |
| `[classNamePrefix]__input`              | `${testId}-select--input`                |
| `[classNamePrefix]__placeholder`        | `${testId}-select--placeholder`          |
| `[classNamePrefix]__value-container`    | `${testId}-select--value-container`      |
| `[classNamePrefix]__indicators`         | `${testId}-select--indicators-container` |
| `[classNamePrefix]__dropdown-indicator` | `${testId}-select--dropdown-indicator`   |
| `[classNamePrefix]__clear-indicator`    | `${testId}-select--clear-indicator`      |
| `[classNamePrefix]__menu`               | `${testId}-select--listbox-container`    |
| `[classNamePrefix]__menu-list`          | `${testId}-select--listbox`              |
| `[classNamePrefix]__option`             | `${testId}-select--option-${id}`         |

Additionally, there are some new locators that have been added:

- `${testId}-select--input-container`
- `${testId}-select--loading-indicator`
- `${testId}-select--group-${groupIndex}-heading`

Lastly, instead of using `className` to produce a locator on the entire select container, you can
now use `${testId}-select--container` instead.

### Testing via `role`

You can also use semantic roles as locators. The following semantic roles have been added to Select:

- `role="combobox"` for the select input
- `role="listbox"` for the select list
- `role="option"` for select options (specify the option label as the `name` to locate a specific
  option)

You can see both `testId` and role's in action by inspecting the following example.

<Example packageName="@atlaskit/select" Component={SelectSingle} />

## Testing with versions < 18.10.4

Being able to programmatically test the behavior of your components is important. Select enables
this through two props `className` and `classNamePrefix`.

Typically when these two props are not defined, the dom-elements in select use emotions generated
classnames. However with `className` and `classNamePrefix`, select generates semantic classnames for
you to reliably search for specific dom elements in the tree.

The value specified in the `className` prop is reflected down to the selects container. While the
value of the `classNamePrefix` prop is reflected down to every single dom element in the tree as a
prefix.

You can see this by inspecting the following example.

<Example packageName="@atlaskit/select" Component={SelectSingle} />

Note here that the `className` of the container element has both the generated css as well as
`single-select` the value of the `className` prop. Every other element in the tree also includes the
generated emotion `classname` as well as a semantic classname preceded by `react-select` the value
passed into the `classNamePrefix`.

Once you provide a `classNamePrefix`, these are the selectors that will be exposed to you:

- `[classNamePrefix]__control`
- `[classNamePrefix]__input`
- `[classNamePrefix]__placeholder`
- `[classNamePrefix]__value-container`
- `[classNamePrefix]__indicators`
- `[classNamePrefix]__dropdown-indicator`
- `[classNamePrefix]__clear-indicator`
- `[classNamePrefix]__menu`
- `[classNamePrefix]__menu-list`
- `[classNamePrefix]__option`

Providing a value for the `className` prop will reflect that value to the class name of the `select`
container.
