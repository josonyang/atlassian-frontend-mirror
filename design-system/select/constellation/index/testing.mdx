import SelectSingle from '../../examples/constellation/select-single';

Being able to programmatically test the behavior of your components is important.
Select enables this through two props `className` and `classNamePrefix`.

Typically when these two props are not defined, the dom-elements in select use emotions generated classnames.
However with `className` and `classNamePrefix`, select generates semantic classnames for you to reliably search for specific dom elements in the tree.

The value specified in the `className` prop is reflected down to the selects container.
While the value of the `classNamePrefix` prop is reflected down to every single dom element in the tree as a prefix.

You can see this by inspecting the following example.

<Example packageName="@atlaskit/select" Component={SelectSingle} />

Note here that the `className` of the container element has both the generated css as well as `single-select` the value of the `className` prop.
Every other element in the tree also includes the generated emotion `classname` as well as a semantic classname preceded by `react-select` the value passed into the `classNamePrefix`.

As such in our tests, we can now reliably assert the state of specific dom elements, like so:

```
  import { BrowserTestCase } from '@atlaskit/webdriver-runner/runner';
  import Page from '@atlaskit/webdriver-runner/wd-wrapper';
  const selectInputElement = '.react-select__input';

  BrowserTestCase('ak/select input should be identifiable by classname',
    {},
    async (client: any) => {
      const page = new Page(client);
      expect(await page.isVisible(selectInputElement)).toBe(true);
    }
  )
```

Once you provide a `classNamePrefix`, these are the selectors that will be exposed to you:

- [classNamePrefix]\_\_control
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_input
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_placeholder
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_value-container
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_indicators
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_dropdown-indicator
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_clear-indicator
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_menu
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_menu-list
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_option

Providing a value for the `className` prop will reflect that value to the class name of the `select` container.
