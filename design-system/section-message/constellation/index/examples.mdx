## Appearance

By default, all section message come with an icon and an area for content. You can optionally add a
`title` and `actions`.

### Information

The `information` section message is the default appearance used to signify a change in state or
important information.

<Example Component={SectionMessageDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />

### Warning

Use a `warning` section message to help people:

- avoid errors
- manage authentication issues
- take the actions needed to avoid potentially dangerous actions
- feel certain they're making the decision, for example, in confirmation modals

<Example Component={SectionMessageWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />

### Success

Use a `success` section message to let the user know that an action or event has happened
successfully.

<Example Component={SectionMessageSuccess} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />

### Error

Use an `error` section message to let people know when:

- something destructive or critical has happened
- access has been denied
- there are connectivity issues

<Example Component={SectionMessageError} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />

### Discovery

Use a `discovery` section message to signify an update to the UI or provide information around new
features and onboarding.

<Example Component={SectionMessageDiscovery} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />

## Actions

Use the `actions` prop to let people act on the content in the section message.

The `SectionMessageAction` component is designed to work with the `actions` prop. In most cases you
should use the section message action, but you can also use any JSX element in the `actions` array.

An action will render a button if you supply an `onClick` handler, or a link if you supply an
`href`. You can override the default link component using the `linkComponent` prop; this works well
with router libraries.

<Example Component={SectionMessageActions} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />

## Dismissible

Use the `isDismissible` prop to allow users to dismiss the message using a button.

The message will be removed from the page, however it requires additional logic to persist the removal across page loads or remounts.

<Example Component={SectionMessageDismissible} packageName="@atlaskit/section-message" />
