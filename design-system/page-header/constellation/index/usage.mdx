## Usage

The page header helps people understand what the page is for, and what to expect on the rest of the
page. Use a page header to create a consistent experience at the top of a full page.

## Anatomy

![In this example page header, the title, breadcrumbs and search options are left-aligned, and the action buttons are right-aligned next to the title.](images/page-header-anatomy.png)

1. **Page grid:** The content area where the page header sits. Each page requires grid spacing to be
   set to account for page size and fixed/fluid pages.
2. **Breadcrumbs:** [Breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumbs/examples) are an optional navigation aid
   that shows people their current location in relation to the rest of the site.
3. **Title:** The page title summarizes the page content. The title wraps onto multiple lines when
   using fluid grid alignment and truncates when using fixed grid alignment.
4. **Actions:** This area contains buttons that modify the page and its content. Use primary,
   secondary, subtle, compact, or other buttons defined in the
   [button guidelines](/components/button/examples).
5. **Search bar and filters:** The search and filter bar allows people to refine the page content
   using [search](/components/textfield/examples) or [select](/components/select/examples).

## Accessibility

- Avoid truncating the text as much as possible.
- `innerRef` exists so that people can set the focus to the DOM element of the title.

## Best practices

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: pageHeaderCountDo,
		alt: 'Page that has one page header at the top. The header is "All open" and shows open Jira work items.',
	}}
>
	Use one page header per page.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: pageHeaderCountDont,
		alt: 'Page that contains multiple page headers. The headers are "All open" and "Design" and show the header being misused to create multiple sections.',
	}}
>
	Use multiple page headers in one page.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: pageHeaderContainerDo,
		alt: 'Full page that has a page header at the top',
	}}
>
	Use a page header at the start of any page in Atlassian apps.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: pageHeaderContainerDont,
		alt: 'Modal that has a page header at the top',
	}}
>
	Use a page header at the top of a smaller container like a popup, dialog, or drawer.
</DoDont>

## Content guidelines

- Headings should be sentence case unless they include proper nouns.
- Headings should be short and let people know what to expect on the page.
