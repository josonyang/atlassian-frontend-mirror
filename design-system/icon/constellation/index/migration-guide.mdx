Select an icon in the [legacy icon explorer](/components/icon/icon-legacy/icon-explorer) to view
replacement options for that icon.

### Atlassian designers

Access the new icons through the Figma library. You may be asked to assist with migrations when
design changes are necessary.

### Atlassian developers

At this stage, only customers who have opted into the early access program (EAP) should see new
icons. Most of the migration process is automated, but there are some decisions that may require
manual changes or design decisions. Review the code migration guide to get started.

### Marketplace partners and app developers

At this time, no changes are necessary, and we'll provide more guidance when it's time for apps to
migrate.

<!-- Here's more on what to expect for each app development and design framework:

- Apps using **Forge UI Kit** may automatically get some icon updates in a future release. Certain changes may still require manual opt-in. We will update with more information soon.
- Developers using design system icons through **Forge custom UI** or **Connect** will need to migrate to the new icons if they want to align with the style changes in the products. We'll provide details on how to do this in a future release.
- We'll update our **community Figma library** with the new icons once they're in beta. -->
