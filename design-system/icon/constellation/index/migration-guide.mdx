Select an icon in the [legacy icon explorer](/components/icon/icon-legacy/icon-explorer) to view
replacement options for that icon.

### Atlassian designers

Access the new icons through the Figma library. You may be asked to assist with migrations when
design changes are necessary.

### Atlassian developers

At this stage, only customers who have opted into the early access program (EAP) should see new
icons. Most of the migration process is automated through the
[no-legacy-icons ESLint auto fixer](/components/eslint-plugin-design-system/no-legacy-icons/usage),
but there are some decisions that may require manual changes or design decisions. Review the code
migration guide to get started.

#### Feature flagging new icons

Atlassian apps can switch between the new icon components and the legacy icons using feature flags
and the `migration` entrypoint - or switch manually via the `LEGACY_fallbackIcon` prop.

<Example Component={IconMigration} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

#### Deprecated prop: `LEGACY_secondaryColor`

The legacy icon prop `secondaryColor` is no longer available in the new icons. To control this, use
the `LEGACY_secondaryColor` prop:

<Example Component={IconMigrationDeprecated} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

#### Migrating icon colors with `LEGACY_primaryColor`

New icons have a type-safe `color` prop, which replaces the `primaryColor` prop on legacy icons. To
provide a different color to the legacy icon than the new icon, use the `LEGACY_primaryColor` prop:

<Example Component={IconMigrationColor} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

#### Updated prop: `LEGACY_size`

The `size` prop for new icons no longer includes `large` and `xlarge` from legacy icons. Note the
dimensions of `medium` and `small` icons have changed to 16px and 12px, as they do not contain
padding. Use the `LEGACY_size` prop to set the size of the old icon to be set to a different value.

For visual balance, prefer `medium` new icons over `small` and migrate `small` legacy icons to
`medium` new icons when possible. For `large` or `xlarge` legacy icons, see
[the usage page](/components/icon/usage#larger-than-16px-icons--consider-icon-tile).

<Example Component={IconMigrationSize} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

#### Setting custom margins with `LEGACY_margin`

The previous icons had built-in padding, which is now turned off by default for easier composition.
We recommend optimizing spacing inside components for icons with `spacing="none"` set. To maintain
parity during migration, you can use the `LEGACY_margin` prop to apply custom margins or other
adjustments to the legacy icons.

<Example Component={IconMigrationMargin} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

### Marketplace partners and app developers

We recommend all partners start migrating your apps from the legacy icons to the new iconography
system to match Atlassian's new visual language.

The new iconography system as part of the Atlassian Design System is now in General Availability,
and we have deprecated the legacy iconography system. It will be removed at the end of the 6-month
deprecation window.

We are committed to supporting you through this transition:

1. Migration Support for Connect and Forge Custom UI:
   - Updated documentation, tooling, and lint rules are available to guide the migration process.
     Details on the spacing prop and new size options can be found at our
     [iconography size and spacing guidance](/foundations/iconography#size-and-spacing).
   - The migration pathway is designed to minimise manual effort. Tools like the
     [no-legacy icons](/components/eslint-plugin-design-system/no-legacy-icons/usage) and the
     [no-utility-icons](/components/eslint-plugin-design-system/no-utility-icons/usage) lint rules
     can automate much of the process, including migrating away from legacy icons, i.e. the
     `@atlaskit/icon/glyph` package, migrating utility icons to core icons and switching to the
     recommended sizes.
   - The two-step migration (using temporary migration entry points) is no longer required. You can
     directly migrate to the @atlaskit/icon/core entry points.
2. Migration support for Forge UI Kit:
   - This will be shipping shortly alongside updated documentation, as part of the iconography
     system reaching GA.
