Select an icon in the [legacy icon explorer](/components/icon/icon-legacy/icon-explorer) to view
replacement options for that icon.

### Atlassian designers

Access the new icons through the Figma library. You may be asked to assist with migrations when
design changes are necessary.

### Atlassian developers

At this stage, only customers who have opted into the early access program (EAP) should see new
icons. Most of the migration process is automated, but there are some decisions that may require
manual changes or design decisions. Review the code migration guide to get started.

[Code icon migrations (Atlassians only)](https://go.atlassian.com/ads-icon-code-migration)

#### Feature flagging new icons

Atlassian products can feature flag between the new icon components, and the legacy icons, via the
`migration` entrypoint - or manually via the `LEGACY_fallbackIcon` prop.

<Example
	Component={IconMigration}
	packageName="@atlaskit/icon"
	disableCodeTransforms={[CODE_TRANSFORM_ID_MIGRATION_ICONS]}
/>

#### Deprecated prop: `LEGACY_secondaryColor`

The legacy icon prop `secondaryColor` is no longer available in the new icons. To control this, use
the `LEGACY_secondaryColor` prop:

<Example
	Component={IconMigrationDeprecated}
	packageName="@atlaskit/icon"
	disableCodeTransforms={[CODE_TRANSFORM_ID_MIGRATION_ICONS]}
/>

#### Migrating icon colors with `LEGACY_primaryColor`

New icons have a type-safe `color` prop, which replaces the `primaryColor` prop on legacy icons. To
provide a different color to the legacy icon than the new icon, use the `LEGACY_primaryColor` prop:

<Example
	Component={IconMigrationColor}
	packageName="@atlaskit/icon"
	disableCodeTransforms={[CODE_TRANSFORM_ID_MIGRATION_ICONS]}
/>

#### Updated prop: `LEGACY_size`

The `size` prop for new icons no longer includes `large` and `xlarge` from legacy icons. Note the
dimensions of `medium` and `small` icons have changed to 16px and 12px, as they do not contain
padding. Use the `LEGACY_size` prop to set the size of the old icon to be set to a different value.

For visual balance, prefer `medium` new icons over `small` and migrate `small` legacy icons to
`medium` new icons when possible. For `large` or `xlarge` legacy icons, see
[the usage page](/components/icon/usage#larger-than-16px-icons--consider-icon-tile).

<Example
	Component={IconMigrationSize}
	packageName="@atlaskit/icon"
	disableCodeTransforms={[CODE_TRANSFORM_ID_MIGRATION_ICONS]}
/>

#### Setting custom margins with `LEGACY_margin`

The previous icons had built-in padding, which is now turned off by default for easier composition.
We recommend optimizing spacing inside components for icons with `spacing="none"` set. To maintain
parity during migration, you can use the `LEGACY_margin` prop to apply custom margins or other
adjustments to the legacy icons.

<Example
	Component={IconMigrationMargin}
	packageName="@atlaskit/icon"
	disableCodeTransforms={[CODE_TRANSFORM_ID_MIGRATION_ICONS]}
/>

### Marketplace partners and app developers

At this time, no changes are necessary, and we'll provide more guidance when it's time for apps to
migrate.

<!-- Here's more on what to expect for each app development and design framework:

- Apps using **Forge UI Kit** may automatically get some icon updates in a future release. Certain changes may still require manual opt-in. We will update with more information soon.
- Developers using design system icons through **Forge custom UI** or **Connect** will need to migrate to the new icons if they want to align with the style changes in the products. We'll provide details on how to do this in a future release.
- We'll update our **community Figma library** with the new icons once they're in beta. -->

Check the
[latest refresh information for details](/whats-new/atlassian-ui-refresh-updates#for-marketplace-partners).
