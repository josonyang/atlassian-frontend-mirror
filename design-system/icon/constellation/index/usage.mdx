## Usage

Clear and consistent icon use should help people complete tasks, providing more affordance for
certain actions and features across Atlassian products. Use icons following these guidelines.

For more on Atlassian's icon style and how icons are drawn, see the
[iconography foundation](/foundations/iconography).

### Use clear, recognizable icons

There are very few icons that have clear associations across cultures and contexts. Use icons with
clear and established associations to across the web wherever possible.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: settingsDo,
		alt: 'A gear icon, meant to represent settings.',
	}}
>
	Use symbols that clearly represent a concept. Use metaphors with clear and established
	associations across products and industries.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: settingsDont,
		alt: 'A wrench and screwdriver crossed as an icon.',
	}}
>
	Don't use uncommon icons. Be careful when creating or using new symbols as icons. They may be
	confused with other concepts or misunderstood.
</DoDont>

### Icon types: Use icons consistently across Atlassian experiences

We organize our icons in categories to help with consistency across products and features:

- **Single purpose:** Icons that represent a single feature or concept. Avoid using these icons
  outside of their intended purpose.
- **Multi-purpose:** Icons that can be used to represent multiple different things, depending on
  context.

Check the usage description of the icon for details on where it's typically used. You can find these
descriptions in the [icon explorer](/components/icon/icon-explorer) or in Figma.

### Don't overuse icons

Does the icon aid comprehension or detract? Sometimes having an icon on every single menu item can
take away from the overall clarity of a page.

If you're struggling to choose a clear icon for every item in a view or menu, reconsider whether the
icons are needed at all.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: menuDo,
		alt: 'A more actions menu where each menu item is simple text label.',
	}}
>
	Use an icon to aid navigation and provide clarity.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: menuDont,
		alt: 'A more actions menu where each menu item has a different icon preceding the text label. Other icon buttons surround the menu.',
	}}
>
	Don't use too many icons in an area. This can create visual noise and make things harder to find.
</DoDont>

## Accessibility

Make sure any meaningful icons are legible and understandable, including to people using assistive
technologies.

### Use text labels to support comprehension

Very few icons are clear to all users. Use text labels to clarify what a feature or button is for.

If a UI element has a text label, there’s usually no need to provide an accessible label for the
icon as well. The visible text label should communicate the same idea as the icon, and repeating
this info to assistive technologies isn’t necessary.

### Provide accessible labels for icons that communicate additional information

Most of the time, icons are associated with text labels on buttons or other elements. In these
cases, don’t provide alternative text for the icon, because the label describes the meaning of the
icon already. In code, this can be done by setting the required `label` prop to an empty string
(`""`).

If an icon doesn’t have an existing text label or accessible text, provide a clear label with the
`label` prop.

Sometimes an icon communicates additional information about a feature, such as a warning status or
external link icon. In these cases, make sure that information is available to people using
assistive technologies, either through the icon label or through other methods.

### Target size

When icons are placed inside interactive elements, such as buttons and links, the size of the target
for pointer inputs should be a minimum of 24 by 24 pixels, unless exempt from
[Target Size (Minimum) (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html).

Using [icon button](/components/button/icon-button) will ensure the target is large enough, but use
caution when composing custom selectable elements with icons.

## Spacing and sizing

### Don't scale or resize icons

Our icons were designed to work in harmony with the typography and spacing systems across Atlassian
products. Don't scale or resize the icons. Instead, use existing sizes and components.

### Core 16px icons (default)

The majority of icons in products are 16 by 16px.

Icons have no padding by default, allowing the buttons or other components to control the whitespace
between icons and other elements. Use center-alignment to position icons in larger spaces.

### Utility 12px icons

A select few icons are available at a smaller size for visual alignment in small spaces. Because the
size is smaller and harder to read, we only offer certain system icons at this size.

### Larger than 16px icons — consider icon tile

We don't offer regular icons larger than 16px.

The icon tile, however, comes in varying sizes for specific use cases requiring more emphasis or
color. Consider using [icon tile](/components/icon/icon-tile/usage) for icons larger than 16px.

## Data Center products

For all new features, we recommend using [Atlassian Design System](/components/) and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
