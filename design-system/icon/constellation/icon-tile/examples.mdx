## Icon tile sizes and appearances

Icon tile places an icon on background tile of a specified size, shape and color. It allows icons to
be prominently highlighted in a layout, such as next to a heading.

### Shape

Icon Tile is available in two shapes: `square` and `circle`.

<Example Component={IconTileShape} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

### Size

Unlike standard icons, icons inside Icon Tiles can scale up and down for use in different layouts.
There are five options, representing the width and height in pixels: `16`, `24`, `36`, `40` and
`48`.

<Example Component={IconTileSize} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />

### Appearance

Appearance options for Icon Tile exist for each hue of available accent token, including `bold`
variants that provide more contrast.

<Example Component={IconTileAppearance} packageName="@atlaskit/icon" />
