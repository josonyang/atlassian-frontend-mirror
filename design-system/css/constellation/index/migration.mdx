## Migration to `@atlaskit/css`

`@atlaskit/css` is the replacement for `@atlaskit/primitives/xcss` which will only work with the
Compiled variants of packages, eg. `@atlaskit/primitives/compiled` (note that not all packages will
be migrated to Compiled by the end of 2024).

Typically, this migration means moving from the `const styles = xcss({ padding: 'space.100' })` API
to a `const styles = cssMap({ root: { padding: token('space.100') } })` API, and we have a codemod
to assist with a majority of this migration for you. Some things are not available in the Compiled
API such as dynamic styles or imports, please use the
[UI Styling Standard ESLint Plugin](/components/eslint-plugin-ui-styling-standard/) to guide you.

Refer to [Configuration required](/components/css/examples#configuration-required) for details on
how to configure your project to use `@atlaskit/css`

## Codemod

We have a codemod to assist in migrations from `xcss()` to `@atlaskit/css`

```sh
npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser tsx --extensions ts,tsx,js ./path/to/folder
```

The CLI will show a list of components and versions. Select
`@atlaskit/css: 0.5.2-primitives-emotion-to-compiled` and your code will be migrated to the
`@atlaskit/css` API instead.

The codemod should migrate something like this:

```diff
/**
 * @jsxRuntime classic
 * @jsx jsx
 */
-import { Box, xcss } from '@atlaskit/primitives';
+import { cssMap, jsx } from '@atlaskit/css';
+import { Box } from '@atlaskit/primitives/compiled';
+import { token } from '@atlaskit/tokens';

-const styles = xcss({
-  color: 'color.text',
-  zIndex: 'layer',
-  backgroundColor: 'elevation.surface.hovered',
+const styles = cssMap({
+  root: {
+    color: token('color.text'),
+    zIndex: 400,
+    backgroundColor: token('elevation.surface.hovered'),
+  },
});

-export const MyComponent = () => <Box xcss={styles} />;
+export const MyComponent = () => <Box xcss={styles.root} />;
```

Please note there may be very minute differences in this migration if you do not have theming
enabled as `@atlaskit/primitives` and the Compiled variant of `@atlaskit/primitives/compiled` have
different fallback colors. They are unchanged with theming applied, this will only happen if you're
in an unthemed environment (which is not suggested).
