## Default

The default form of spinner.

<Example Component={BasicExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Sizes

- **Extra small**: Use this size inside toggles.
- **Small**: Use within elements such as buttons or form fields, or when there are other space constraints.
- **Medium**: The default size. We recommend using the `medium` size for most use cases.
- **Large**
- **Extra large**

<Example Component={SizeExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Theming

A spinner will respect the current theme. You can invert the color of a spinner by setting `appearance="invert"`. This is useful when you are displaying a spinner on a background that is not the same color as the main content.

<Example Component={ThemingExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Animation

A spinner will always animate itself in. For graceful exit animations we recommend that you use `<FadeIn />` from [motion](/components/motion/about)

<Example Component={AnimatedExitExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Spinner over content

When using a spinner directly over content, apply the `opacity.loading` token to the content container to de-emphasize the content and increase the visibility of the spinner.

<Example
  Component={SpinnerOverContentExample}
  packageName="@atlaskit/spinner"
/>

## Delaying a spinner

Sometimes you might want to delay showing a spinner when loading something asynchronously.

#### Spinner flashing

The `<Spinner />` is only visible to a user after `150-200ms` of being rendered because of it's opacity fade in. There is no need to delay a spinner to prevent it quickly flashing on an initial load. If you are concerned about having a spinner flash quickly and then harshly be removed, we recommend that you use `<FadeIn />` from [motion](/components/motion/about/) to gracefully animate the unmount of a spinner.

#### Long pausing

Sometimes you will want to delay a spinner from showing for a longer period of time.

A spinner has a `delay` prop that can be used to achieve a long pause. You can set the value to `500-1000+ ms` to prevent a spinner from being shown for a longer period of time.

For best results, use `<FadeIn />` from [motion](/components/motion/about/) to fade out the spinner. It's still possible for the spinner to show briefly when your async operation takes slightly longer than your long delay. Fading out your spinner will always look best.
