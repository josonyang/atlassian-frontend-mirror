## Default

Use this to render a skeleton element that's the same size as an item. Use this when you're asynchronously loading data for a menu, it has not yet loaded, and you know what the data will look like after it has loaded.

<Example Component={SkeletonItemDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
