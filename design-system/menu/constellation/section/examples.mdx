## Default

Use sections to group related items in a menu, with an optional heading component.

You should always group items in sections, even if there's only one item in the group. Including a heading when there's more than one item in the section will improve the accessibility of the menu.

<Example Component={SectionDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />

## Scrollable

Sections constrained by height will become scrollable if the `isScrollable` prop is supplied.

<Example Component={SectionScrollable} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
