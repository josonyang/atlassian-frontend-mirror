## Usage

Use the menu component to help people find their way around your product or take actions.

The menu component is composed using multiple smaller components such as the menu group, sections, headings, button and link items.

If the menu has distinct sections, and some sections are more important than others, prioritise the most important tasks first.

## Accessibility

Compose your menu with the correct semantic elements using [sections](/components/menu/section), [heading items](/components/menu/heading-item), [button items](/components/menu/button-item), and [link items](/components/menu/link-item).

- If you’re sending people to another page or context, use a [link item](/components/menu/link-item). Only use buttons if the menu item performs a task other than just changing destination.
- Always compose your menu using [sections](/components/menu/section), even if there’s only one section. Sections support better navigation for assistive technology by default.
- Don’t disable menu items. Leave the menu item enabled, and use visual affordance and error messaging to let people know why the menu item is unavailable.
- If your menu appears in more than one place, make sure that the order and availability of menu items is consistent throughout your product.
- Avoid icons if possible. If icons are included, make sure any meaningful imagery has alternative text.

## Content guidelines

Keep menu labels concise, and avoid unnecessary verbs, jargon, or brand names. Navigation doesn’t benefit from conversational language, and putting the most important word at the start of the label helps people navigate quickly.

Organise your menu items based on priority, and put the most used items at the start of the menu.

Make sure that your menu helps people complete their tasks. Test your category and label names using tree testing or card sorting research methods. Remember that putting more items in a menu doesn’t necessarily translate to more exposure or usage.
