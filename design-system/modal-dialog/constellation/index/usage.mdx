## Usage

Use modal dialogs to present a short-term task the user needs to perform. This can include critical or warning information where a response is required, however theyâ€™re also intended to support efficient task completion without losing the context of the underlying page. Users won't be able to interact with the page until the dialog is closed.

In some cases, modals contain information that requires additional help and support. You can add elements like filters or hint text to the modal dialog, but be mindful of dialog real estate.

Although highly versatile, this doesn't mean modal dialogs are fit for all purposes. Modal dialogs are invasive and should be used sparingly. The ability of the user to access and view their own content is important for a good experience.

## Anatomy

![The modal is made up of three parts, a header and body text, both are left-aligned, and a footer with two right-aligned buttons: a primary action button, and a button to close the dialog.](../images/modal-dialog-anatomy.png)

- **Header:** Contains the modal title.
- **Body:** Provides an overview of the modal's purpose and, optionally, controls to complete a task.
- **Footer:** Contains a primary action and the ability to cancel and close the dialog.

## Best practices

- Limit the number of interactions in a modal dialog. Simplify by removing unnecessary elements or content that does not support the task.
- Avoid multiple steps that require navigation within the modal dialog.
- Avoid complex decision making that requires additional sources of information unavailable in the modal.
- This modal dialog is responsive. When adding contents, respect the dimensions set by modal dialog to maintain responsiveness.
- It's best to support multiple methods for dismissal, however the use of both Cancel and X is not required on desktop.

## Content guidelines

- Modal dialog titles should use sentence case and prioritize keywords.
- Modal dialog body copy should contain only valuable and relevant information that is both helpful and concise.
- Label elements with action verbs that indicate what happens when the element is selected. For example, label a select menu with Choose a user instead of Users.
- The main action (a [primary button](/components/button/examples#primary)) should reflect the modal title. For example, a modal with the title "Fork &lt;repository name&gt;" has a button labeled "Fork repository". The title "Select a template" has a button labeled "Select".

## Accessibility

### Labeling modals

Modals must have a title or label so that users can understand what the modal is for. There are three ways you can ensure you have an accessible name for your modal:

1. Use the modal title component (see the [modal header example](/components/modal-dialog/examples#modal-header))
2. Add the `titleId` from the `useModal` hook to an element within your modal (see the [custom header example](/components/modal-dialog/examples#custom-modal-header))
3. Use the `label` prop (this should almost never be used as there is no visual title available for sighted users).

### Dismissing modals

Users can't interact with the rest of the page until the modal is closed. To cater for both mouse and keyboard interactions we've included numerous ways to dismiss a modal dialog:

- Click **Cancel** in the footer
- Click **X** in the header (if included)
- Press `Esc` on a keyboard
- Click anywhere on the blanket
