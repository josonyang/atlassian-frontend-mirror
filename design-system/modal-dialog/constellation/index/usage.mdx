## Usage

Use a modal dialog to present an immediate task a user needs to perform. This can include critical
or warning information where a response is required or an action to support task completion, without
losing the context of the underlying page.

Users can’t interact with the page until the dialog is closed.

In some cases, you can add support information to a dialog modal, such as filters or hint text, but
remember to keep the content concise and direct as space is limited.

Although highly versatile, modal dialogs aren't fit for all purposes. They can be invasive and
should be used sparingly.

## Anatomy

![The modal is made up of four parts, a header, body text, both left-aligned, a close button in the header, right-aligned, and a footer with two right-aligned buttons: a button to close the dialog and a primary action button.](../images/modal-dialog-anatomy.png)

1. **Header:** Contains the modal title. It should always be a level `h1` heading.
2. **Button** Closes the modal dialog from the header.
3. **Body:** Provides an overview of the modal dialog's purpose and any controls that might be
   needed to complete a task.
4. **Footer:** Contains a primary action and the ability to cancel or close the dialog.

## Accessibility

### Indicating severity

Don't rely on color alone to indicate severity. Provide an accessible `label` for the warning and
error icons.

### Labeling modals

Modals must have a title so all users can understand what the modal is for.

There are 3 ways to make sure your modal has an accessible title:

1. Use the modal title component (view the
   [modal header example](/components/modal-dialog/examples#modal-header)).
2. Add the `titleId` from the `useModal` hook to an element within your modal (view the
   [custom header example](/components/modal-dialog/examples#custom-modal-header)).
3. Use the `label` prop – though this should be avoided as it means there's no visual title
   available for sighted users.

### Dismissing modals

Users can't interact with the rest of the page until a modal is closed. To help both mouse and
keyboard users perform this action, the dialog can be closed by:

- Selecting the **close button** in the header
- Pressing `Esc` on a keyboard
- Selecting anywhere outside the modal (in the blanket)
- Selecting **Cancel** or **Close** in the footer (optional)

A close button in the header should always be used, except in extremely rare circumstances.

If you think an exception applies to your use case, you must contact the accessibility team to
confirm. Otherwise, it could introduce an accessibility violation.

### Setting focus

Focus order should follow a logical and predictable sequence for keyboard and screen reader users.

The focus should move as follows:

1. **Close button in header**: If the modal doesn’t have a close button, focus should start on the
   title. If there isn’t a title, focus should start on the container (modal window).
2. **Main content**: For form fields or other interactive elements, focus should move to the first
   focusable element. If the content is text and not actionable, focus should move to the text.
3. **Secondary button**, if using.
4. **Primary button**.
5. **Modal trigger**: When the modal is closed, focus should return to the element that triggered
   the modal.

## Best practices

- Limit the number of interactions in a modal dialog. Simplify by removing unnecessary elements or
  content that doesn't support the task.
- Avoid multiple steps that require navigation within the modal dialog.
- Provide all the information a user needs to complete the task within the modal. Avoid complex
  decision-making that requires additional information not available in the modal.
- Modal dialogs are responsive. When adding content, respect the dimensions set by modal dialog to
  maintain responsiveness.
- Support multiple methods for dismissal. A ‘close’ button is required in the header, but decide
  whether a ‘cancel’ or 'close’ button is needed in the footer.

### Button alignment

When adding buttons to the footer, place them on the right.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: bottomRightDo,
		alt: 'Two buttons in a group are correctly placed in the bottom-right corner of the modal. The first is a secondary subtle button without a border and says cancel. The second is a primary button, blue in color, and says duplicate.',
	}}
>
	Align buttons on the right in the footer. <br /> <br /> If you have more than 1 button, place the
	primary button to the right of the secondary button.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: bottomRightDont,
		alt: 'Two buttons in a group are incorrectly placed in the bottom-left corner of the modal. The first is a primary button, blue in color, and says duplicate. The second is a secondary subtle button without a border and says cancel.',
	}}
>
	Don’t place buttons to the left or middle of the footer. This can confuse users and disrupt the
	expected flow of actions. <br/> <br/> Don't put primary buttons to the left of secondary or tertiary buttons.

</DoDont>

### Simple and focused experiences

Avoid complex experiences and scrolling behavior as they reduce the usability of the experience.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: focusDo,
		alt: 'A simple share permissions modal with a form field labeled details, a permissions section to decide who can access or edit the page, and two buttons located at the bottom right of the modal: a secondary subtle cancel button and a primary blue share button.',
	}}
>
	Keep `h1` headings and body content concise and clear. Focus on a single task or message.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: focusDont,
		alt: 'A complex share permissions modal with 3 tabs titled permissions, admin, and public, a general access section with 3 calls to action titled open, can edit, and copy link, additional content that is partially hidden, and two buttons located at the bottom right of the modal: a secondary subtle cancel button and a primary blue share button.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use a modal dialog for complex interactions or large tables. <br /> <br /> Avoid horizontal
	scrolling and minimize vertical scrolling whenever possible.
</DoDont>

### Nesting

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: nestingDo,
		alt: 'A single modal with 3 lines of body copy explaining how to duplicate a page and two buttons located at the bottom right of the footer: a secondary subtle cancel button and a primary blue confirm button.',
	}}
>
	Modal dialogs should appear above a blanket that covers the main page content. Use one at a time.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: nestingDont,
		alt: 'A second modal titled select location opens on top of another modal, hiding the content of the first modal. It contains a form field labeled space, a dropdown selection, and two buttons located at the bottom right of the modal: a secondary subtle cancel button and a primary blue confirm button. The same buttons can be seen in the modal underneath, so it is not clear which one to select.',
	}}
>
	Don’t use dialogs to trigger other dialogs, as this is inaccessible and confusing. <br /> <br />{' '}
	Instead, make sure links or buttons open in a new tab or dismiss the modal.
</DoDont>

## Content guidelines

- Body copy for a modal dialog should contain only valuable and relevant information.
- In label elements, use action verbs that indicate what happens when the element is selected. For
  example, label a select menu with 'Choose a user' instead of 'Users.
- The main action (a [primary button](/components/button/examples#primary)) should reflect the modal
  title.
  - For example, a modal with the title 'Fork &lt;repository name&gt;' should have a button labeled
    'Fork repository'.
  - The title 'Select a template' should have a button labeled 'Select'.

- Use [popups](/components/popup/) for smaller amounts of information along with controls.
- To onboard or update people about new functionality, use custom modal dialog or
  [spotlight](/patterns/spotlight) pattern.
- To alert people about important information, or an action that's required to complete a task, use
  [inline messages](/components/inline-message).
