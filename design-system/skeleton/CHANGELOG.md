  Migrated from `@emotion/react` to `@compiled/react` in order to improve performance, align with
  the rest of the Atlaskit techstack, and support React 18 Streaming SSR.

  Please note, in order to use this version of `@atlaskit/skeleton`, you will need to ensure that
  your bundler is configured to handle `.css` imports correctly. Most bundlers come with built-in
  support for `.css` imports, so you may not need to do anything. If you are using a different
  bundler, please refer to the documentation for that bundler to understand how to handle `.css`
  imports.

  For more information on the migration, please refer to
  [RFC-73 Migrating our components to Compiled CSS-in-JS](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/rfc-73-migrating-our-components-to-compiled-css-in-js/85953).
