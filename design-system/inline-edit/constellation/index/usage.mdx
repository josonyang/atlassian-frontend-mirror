## Usage

Use inline edit on screens where information needs to be updated often, such as a view issue page.
People can toggle between read view and edit view without leaving the page.

Use this instead of a [form](/components/form/examples) when you have information that may already
exist and can be edited.

Inline edit can use data input components such as a [text field](/components/textfield),
[select](/components/select) and
[datetime picker](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/design-system/datetime-picker). The
appearance of the inline edit will vary depending on which components it is used with.

### Read view

1. ** Label: ** Labels are concise, sentence case text describing what to enter in the field.

2. ** Field: ** When in read view, the field is hidden and aligned with the label. When in an empty
   state, you can customise what placeholder text is shown here.

### Edit view

1. ** Label: ** Labels are concise, sentence case text describing what to enter in the field.

2. ** Field: ** When in edit view, the field snaps to the width of the column and the text remains
   aligned with the label.

3. ** Controls: ** Options to save or cancel the current data entry appear at the end of the field.

## Accessibility

- For larger areas of text, set `keepEditViewOpenOnBlur` to true. This ensures that inline edit
  stays in editing mode when the user clicks or moves away. This is recommended to help prevent
  people from accidentally discarding or saving their unfinished work.
- Keep action buttons visible wherever possible. The contents in the field are saved when the user
  navigates away from the element, but this isn't immediately obvious on its' own.
- Make sure that inline edit fields have enough visual affordance that sighted people recognise them
  as editable, especially if you are using custom font sizing.
- Only use `placeholder` prop to show default values. Don't use it to act as a label for the field.

## Behavior

Inline edit wraps around any standard text field. Any styling of the text field component is handled
outside of this component. If you are placing a custom inline edit on a component like a header,
check that the font and box size line up properly.

Since inline edit is used for entering content, it's optimized for use with keyboard inputs (use
return to save and esc to cancel). When using a mouse, controls should always display at the end of
the field. For example, at the bottom right in a left-to-right reading order.

## Best practices

- Use inline edit for an editable field that is not part of a [form](/patterns/forms). Don't use
  inline edit inside of a form.
- If you need a simple inline editable text field, use
  [inline editable textfield component](/components/inline-edit/inline-editable-textfield/examples)
  to get our recommended default settings.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: inlineEditDo,
		alt: 'Inline edit header in read view and edit view with the same styling and layout.',
	}}
>
	To avoid confusing experiences, ensure read view and edit view components have identical styling.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: inlineEditDont,
		alt: 'When editing, the inline edit has a different text size and font weight.',
	}}
>
	Pass in read view and edit view components that have different styling.
</DoDont>
