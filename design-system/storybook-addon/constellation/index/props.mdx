After installing the package, register the addon with your Storybook configuration in the
`.storybook/main.js` file.

```diff
module.exports = {
  addons: [
+    '@atlaskit/storybook-addon-design-system'
  ]
};
```

## Storybook v6 and below

Add the decorator to `.storybook/preview.js`, which is responsible for applying the logic which has
the ability to modify the DOM of your stories.

```diff
+ import { withDesignTokens } from '@atlaskit/storybook-addon-design-system';

const { addDecorator } = require('@storybook/react');

+ addDecorator(withDesignTokens);
```

## Storybook v7 and above

For Storybook version 7, the following changes are necessary:

1. Initialising the `globalTypes.adsTheme` property in the global context
2. Disable the
   [built in `backgrounds` add on](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/backgrounds#disable-backgrounds),
   as it conflicts with the ADS theming

Both of these can be done in
[the `preview` file](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure#configure-story-rendering):

```diff
+ import { withDesignTokens } from '@atlaskit/storybook-addon-design-system';

const preview = {
  globalTypes: {
+     adsTheme: {
+       description: 'Atlassian Design System theming options',
+       defaultValue: 'light',
    },
  },
  decorators: [
+     withDesignTokens
  ],
  parameters: {
+     /**
+      * Disabling the builtin backgrounds addon so it doesn't override the ADS theming
+      * See: https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/backgrounds#disable-backgrounds
+      */
+     backgrounds: { disable: true },
  },
};

export default preview;
```
