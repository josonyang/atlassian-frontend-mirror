After installing the package, register the addon with your Storybook configuration in the `.storybook/main.js` file.

```diff
module.exports = {
  addons: [
+    '@atlaskit/storybook-addon-design-system'
  ]
};
```

To add the decorator to `.storybook/preview.js`, which is responsible for applying the logic which has the ability to modify the DOM of your stories.

```diff
+import { withDesignTokens } from '@atlaskit/storybook-addon-design-system';

const { addDecorator } = require('@storybook/react');

+addDecorator(withDesignTokens);
```
