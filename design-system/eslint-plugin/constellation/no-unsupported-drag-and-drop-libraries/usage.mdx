# no-unsupported-drag-and-drop-libraries

We encourage the use of Pragmatic drag and drop to power all drag and drop experiences - from table to external files. Pragmatic drag and drop is a performance optimised drag and drop framework that has been designed to power any drag and drop experience on any tech stack. Please avoid using alternative drag and drop libraries as it will lead to poorer performance, increased maintenance costs, (likely) worse accessibility and fragmented user experiences. See https://staging.atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/

## Examples

Libraries such as `react-beautiful-dnd` and `@atlassian/jira-dnd` that are no longer supported, as well as external libraries such as `react-dnd` and `react-sortable-hoc`.

### Incorrect

```ts
import { DraggableLocation } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd'
                         ^^^^^^^^^
```
