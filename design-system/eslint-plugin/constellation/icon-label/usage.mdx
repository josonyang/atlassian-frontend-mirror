# icon-label

Icon labels are used to describe what the icon is so the visually impaired can be described what the
UI element is. There are cases where icons should have labels as well as cases where they shouldn't
be labelled.

## Examples

This rule will find violations for when an icon label is or isn't needed when composed with other
Design System components.

### Incorrect

```js
import ActivityIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/activity'

<ActivityIcon>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ missing `label` prop

<Button iconLeft={<ActivityIcon label="">} />
                                ^^^^^ label should be defined

<ButtonItem iconBefore={<ActivityIcon label="">}>
                                      ^^^^^ label should not be defined
  My activity
</ButtonItem>
```

### Correct

```js
import ActivityIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/activity'

<ActivityIcon label="Activity">

<Button iconLeft={<ActivityIcon label="Activity">} />

<ButtonItem iconBefore={<ActivityIcon label="">}>
  My activity
</ButtonItem>
```
