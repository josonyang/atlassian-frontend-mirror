# no-unsafe-design-token-usage

Using design tokens in an unsafe way risks the health of the system and will effect how fast your
codebase can migrate between versions.

## Examples

This rule will mark design token usage that is not statically and locally analyzable, as well as
design tokens that are considered deleted.

## Incorrect

```js
const textColor = 'red';

css({ color: textColor });
             ^^^^^^^^^ must be a string literal
```

```js
css({ boxShadow: '0px 1px 1px var(--ds-accent-subtleBlue)' });
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ must use the token() function
```

## Correct

```js
import { token } from '@atlaskit/tokens';

css({ boxShadow: token('elevation.shadow.card') });

css`
	color: ${(token('color.text.highemphasis'), N20)};
`;
```

## Options

This rule comes with options to aid in migrating to design tokens.

### fallbackUsage

- `forced`: Fallback values must always be provided
- `none`: Fallback values must never be provided. (Fixer will remove if provided)
- `optional`: Fallbacks are optional

### shouldEnforceFallbacks (deprecated)

When `true` the rule will mark token function usage as violations when fallbacks aren't defined.
When `false` the rule will mark token function usage as violations when fallbacks are defined.
