# no-exported-css

Disallows `css` export declarations that originate from `@compiled/react` and `@atlaskit/css`, as well as any other CSS-in-JS library defined through the `importSources` option.

In Compiled, exporting css declarations may result in unexpected errors when imported, because its value will be `null` at runtime. Additionally, co-locating css definitions with their usage is considered best practice in order to improve code readability and build performance.

## Examples

### Incorrect

```tsx
import { css } from '@compiled/react';

export const styles = css({});

export default css({});
```

### Correct

```tsx
import { css } from '@compiled/react';

const styles = css({});
```

## Options

### importSources

By default, this rule will check `css` usages from:

- `@atlaskit/css`
- `@atlaskit/primitives`
- `@compiled/react`
- `@emotion/react`
- `@emotion/core`
- `@emotion/styled`
- `styled-components`

To change this list of libraries, you can define a custom set of `importSources`, which accepts an array of package names (strings).

```tsx
// [{ importSources: ['other-lib'] }]

import { css } from 'other-lib';

// Invalid!
export const styles = css({});
```
