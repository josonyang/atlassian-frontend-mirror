## Usage

Use toggles to let people turn something on or off instantly. For example, if you need to enable public access to a resource.

If a physical switch would work for the action, a toggle is the best component to use.

## Accessibility

- If you're using a disabled toggle, include information explaining why the option isn't available. You can also use [visually hidden](/components/visually-hidden) to tell people who use screen readers that there is an option that isn't available to them.
- Avoid changing the toggle label based on the on or off state. The label should be the same regardless of the current toggle setting.
- Label your toggle using `id` and `htmlFor` props to set the relationship. For more information see [labels on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

## Best practices

- Let people know what happens when the toggle is switched by using a [tooltip](/components/tooltip).
- Toggles should never require people to press a button to apply the settings.

## Content guidelines

When writing tooltips for toggle states, be concise and follow the [writing guidelines](/content/writing-style).

## Server

[Toggles](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/toggle-button.html) are larger in AUIâ€™s implementation.
