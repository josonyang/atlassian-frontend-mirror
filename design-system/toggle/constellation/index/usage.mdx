## Usage

Use toggles to let people turn something on or off instantly. For example, if you need to enable
public access to a resource.

If a physical switch would work for the action, a toggle is the best component to use.

## Accessibility

- If you're using a disabled toggle, include information explaining why the option isn't available.
  You can also use [visually hidden](/components/visually-hidden) to tell people who use screen
  readers that there is an option that isn't available to them.
- Avoid changing the toggle label based on the on or off state. The label should be the same
  regardless of the current toggle setting.
- Label your toggle using `id` and `htmlFor` props to set the relationship. For more information see
  [labels on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

## Best practices

- Let people know what happens when the toggle is switched by using a
  [tooltip](/components/tooltip).
- Toggles should never require people to press a button to apply the settings.
- The toggle component doesn't work within the form component by default. This is because the toggle
  is supposed to make change happen instantly, not after pressing a submit button. For options that
  require a button press to apply the setting, use a [checkbox](/components/checkbox).

## Data Center apps

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
