## Usage

Use forms when input is required to complete an action. Forms direct people to provide and submit
relevant information, such as changing personal settings or creating a Jira issue.

Common form components include [text fields](/components/textfield/examples),
[selects](/components/select/examples), [radio buttons](/components/radio/examples),
[checkboxes](/components/checkbox/examples),
[date pickers](/components/datetime-picker/date-picker/examples),
[toggles](/components/toggle/examples), and [buttons](/components/button/examples).

## Anatomy

![The example form is "Create a project" and it has four fields: Project name, key, description, and user access.](../images/form-anatomy.png)

1. **Title:** Use a concise form title to explain the form’s context.
2. **Labels:** Labels are required for all form inputs. Standard label alignment is left-aligned
   with the field underneath. Use a combination of a concise label and helper text to explain the
   field input.
3. **Placeholder text:** Avoid placeholders whenever possible. Never use placeholder text to
   communicate critical information — this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper
   text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can, however, be used
   for search fields or short example entries.
4. **Required field**: Clearly communicate fields that are required. Don’t rely on asterisks alone
   to communicate which fields are required, make sure there is also a legend at the top of the
   form.
5. **Form section:** Use sections to group the form fields into smaller parts.
6. **Disabled fields:** Show disabled fields if users need to know what controls might not be
   available to them.
7. **Form footer:** Always use a submit button and distinguish primary and secondary buttons.

## Accessibility

- Ensure there is a legend at the top of the form so people know that `*` indicates a required
  field.
- Never disable a submit button, even if all of the required fields aren't filled in. Instead,
  describe what needs to be done with clear instructions, validation and error messages.
- Avoid using placeholder text wherever possible. If you do use placeholder text, don't include any
  critical information in the placeholder text.
- Make sure all fields have an accessible label visible. Search fields are sometimes an exception to
  this.
- Use
  [standard HTML autofill tokens](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofilling-form-controls:-the-autocomplete-attribute)
  to reduce typing and user error by letting the browser suggest previously saved information.
- Persist forms on refresh so that user data isn’t lost.
- Validate forms inline so keyboard users don't have to navigate far to get feedback. Ideally, make
  the interactions and written instructions clear to prevent errors happening in the first place,
  and help people fix problems as they occur.
- Match keyboard to input on mobile.

## Best practices

### Layout

Group related sections into logical sets to help people understand the information they need to
enter.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormGroupingDo,
		alt: 'Form example where the fields "Project" and "Issue type" are grouped under a subheading "Location and type".',
	}}
>
	Group related information into form sections.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormGroupingDont,
		alt: 'Form example where the fields are not grouped.',
	}}
>
	Provide one form of unrelated information.
</DoDont>

Use one form column to enable fast field comprehension.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormOneColumnDo,
		alt: 'Form fields are in one column.',
	}}
>
	Use one form column.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormOneColumnDont,
		alt: 'Form fields are in two columns',
	}}
>
	Use multiple form columns.
</DoDont>

Max-width: **624px**, recommended by the [cozy grid](/foundations/grid#gutter-spacing). In other
cases, assume that the width typically follows where the form lives in a modal, focused task, page,
etc.

### Fields and labels

- Reduce the number of fields in your form to avoid a large cognitive load for people, and help them
  submit the form faster.
- Avoid optional fields by only asking for relevant information.
- Avoid using default selections, or, instead, use smart defaults. For example, preselect the user's
  country based on location data.
- Always include a visible label with an input field. Don't use placeholder text in place of labels.
  The only exception to this is for search fields, which often have icons or other indicators of
  purpose.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormDefaultValuesDo,
		alt: 'Account preferences form with the default time zone set to Australia/Brisbane.',
	}}
>
	Provide smart default values.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormDefaultValuesDont,
		alt: 'Account preferences form with the default time zone set to Europe/Amsterdam.',
	}}
>
	Provide random default values.
</DoDont>

Use input masks to help users understand correct field formats.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormInputMasksDo,
		alt: 'The password field is obscured by an input mask.',
	}}
>
	Use input masks to help users understand fields correctly.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormInputMasksDont,
		alt: 'The password field is plain text.',
	}}
>
	Use default inputs for particular fields.
</DoDont>

### Buttons

- State the action that the buttons perform when clicked.
- Avoid multiple action buttons and avoid a reset button. This will reduce confusion about how to
  submit the form.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDo,
		alt: 'Form with a single "Create" action button.',
	}}
>
	Use clear, binary actions for clean form submission.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDont,
		alt: 'Form with a "Create" action button, and a "Manage trials" action button.',
	}}
>
	Use multiple action buttons and a reset button at the bottom of the form.
</DoDont>

Ensure the primary action button provides feedback that the form is being submitted.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormButtonFeedbackDo,
		alt: 'Form where the "Create" button is replaced by a spinner.',
	}}
>
	Give feedback to show that form is being submitted.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormButtonFeedbackDont,
		alt: 'Form where the "Create" button is disabled.',
	}}
>
	Give no feedback on submit.
</DoDont>

### Button positioning

Buttons are sorted by importance from right to left, with the most important button (primary) on the
right.

![Button positioned to the right in a modal.](../images/button-positioning-1.png)

![Button positioned to the right in a page.](../images/button-positioning-2.png)

Exceptions to this are single-page forms, flags, and section messages where buttons are left aligned
with the primary button on the left.
