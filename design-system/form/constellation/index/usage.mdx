## Usage

Use forms when input is required to complete an action. Forms direct people to provide and submit
relevant information, such as changing personal settings or creating a Jira issue.

Think carefully about structure, sequence, interface elements, field labels, help, and feedback.

Common form components include [text fields](/components/textfield/examples),
[selects](/components/select/examples), [radio buttons](/components/radio/examples),
[checkboxes](/components/checkbox/examples),
[date pickers](/components/datetime-picker/date-picker/examples),
[toggles](/components/toggle/examples), and [buttons](/components/button/examples).

## Anatomy

![The example form is "Create a project" and it has five fields: Project name, key, description, project permissions, and user access.](../images/form-anatomy.png)

1. **Title:** Use a concise form title to explain the form’s context. Make sure you follow correct
   [heading hierarchy](/components/heading/usage#hierarchy). If needed, follow the title with a
   short description.
2. **Labels:** Labels are required for all form inputs. Standard label alignment is left-aligned
   with the field underneath. Use a combination of a concise label and helper text to explain the
   field input.
3. **Placeholder text:** Avoid placeholders whenever possible. Never use placeholder text to
   communicate critical information — this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper
   text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can, however, be used
   for search fields.
4. **Required field**: Clearly communicate fields that are required. Don’t rely on asterisks alone
   to communicate which fields are required; make sure there is also a legend at the top of the form
   that says: 'Required fields are marked with an asterisk'. If all fields in the form are
   mandatory, add asterisks to every field and in the legend write 'All fields are required'.
5. **Form section:** Use sections to group the form fields into smaller parts. Include a section
   title to describe the group of controls and fields. Make the title concise and informative. But
   if you need to, you can add a short description to explain the group.
6. **Disabled fields:** Show disabled fields if users need to know what controls might not be
   available to them.
7. **Form footer:** Always use a submit button and distinguish primary and secondary buttons.

**Field length**: The length of the field should reflect the intended length of content. Available
lengths are 75px, 150px, 250px, 350px, and 500px.

## Accessibility

- Ensure there is a legend at the top of the form so people know that `*` indicates a required
  field.
- Autofocus the first field by default. This allows users to tab through elements in the form in a
  logical way.
- Never disable a submit button, even if all of the required fields aren't filled in. Instead,
  describe what needs to be done with clear instructions, and
  [validation and error messages](#validation-and-error-messages).
- Avoid using placeholder text wherever possible. If you do use placeholder text, don't include any
  critical information in the placeholder text.
- Make sure all fields have an accessible label visible. Search fields are sometimes an exception to
  this.
- Use
  [standard HTML autofill tokens](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofilling-form-controls:-the-autocomplete-attribute)
  to reduce typing and user error by letting the browser suggest previously saved information.
- Persist forms on refresh so that user data isn’t lost.
- Validate forms inline so keyboard users don't have to navigate far to get feedback. Ideally, make
  the interactions and written instructions clear to prevent errors happening in the first place,
  and help people fix problems as they occur.
- Use `MessageWrapper` to wrap error messages. This must be not be dynamically loaded but already in
  the DOM at the time the form is rendered.
- Match keyboard to input on mobile.

## Buttons

- State the action that the buttons perform when clicked.
- Use a primary button for the main action then, as required, any standard buttons followed by a
  link button.
- Use a link button for cancel.
- Avoid multiple action buttons and avoid a reset button. This will reduce confusion about how to
  submit the form.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDo,
		alt: 'Form with a single "Create" action button.',
	}}
>
	Use clear, binary actions for clean form submission.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDont,
		alt: 'Form with a "Create" action button, and a "Manage trials" action button.',
	}}
>
	Use multiple action buttons and a reset button at the bottom of the form.
</DoDont>

Ensure the primary action button provides feedback that the form is being submitted.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormButtonFeedbackDo,
		alt: 'Form where the "Create" button is replaced by a spinner.',
	}}
>
	Give feedback to show that form is being submitted.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormButtonFeedbackDont,
		alt: 'Form where the "Create" button is disabled.',
	}}
>
	Provide no feedback on submit.
</DoDont>

## Button positioning

In most cases buttons are sorted by importance from right to left, with the most important button
(primary) on the **right**.

![Button positioned to the right in a modal.](../images/button-positioning-1.png)

![Button positioned to the right in a page.](../images/button-positioning-2.png)

In some cases, **left align buttons** with the **primary button on the left**:

- single-page forms
- multi-step forms
- flags
- section messages
- [Data Center product forms](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/forms.html)

![Button positioned to the left in a form.](../images/button-positioning-3.png)

In other cases, use **center-aligned buttons**:

- Benefits modal
- Login forms

## Layout

Group related sections into logical sets to help people understand the information they need to
enter.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormGroupingDo,
		alt: 'Form example where the fields "Project" and "Issue type" are grouped under a subheading "Location and type".',
	}}
>
	Group related information into form sections.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormGroupingDont,
		alt: 'Form example where the fields are not grouped.',
	}}
>
	Provide one form of unrelated information.
</DoDont>

Use one form column to enable fast field comprehension.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormOneColumnDo,
		alt: 'Form fields are in one column.',
	}}
>
	Use one form column.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormOneColumnDont,
		alt: 'Form fields are in two columns',
	}}
>
	Use multiple form columns.
</DoDont>

Max-width: **624px**, recommended by the [cozy grid](/foundations/grid#gutter-spacing). In other
cases, assume that the width typically follows where the form lives in a modal, focused task, page,
etc.

## Fields and labels

- Reduce the number of fields in your form to avoid a large cognitive load for people, and help them
  submit the form faster.
- Avoid optional fields by only asking for relevant information.
- Avoid using default selections, or, instead, use smart defaults. For example, preselect the user's
  country based on location data.
- Always include a visible label with an input field. Don't use placeholder text in place of labels.
  The only exception to this is for search fields, which often have icons or other indicators of
  purpose.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormDefaultValuesDo,
		alt: 'Account preferences form with the default time zone set to Australia/Brisbane.',
	}}
>
	Provide smart default values.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormDefaultValuesDont,
		alt: 'Account preferences form with the default time zone set to Europe/Amsterdam.',
	}}
>
	Provide random default values.
</DoDont>

Use input masks to help users understand correct field formats.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: FormInputMasksDo,
		alt: 'The password field is obscured by an input mask.',
	}}
>
	Use input masks.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: FormInputMasksDont,
		alt: 'The password field is plain text.',
	}}
>
	Use default inputs for particular fields.
</DoDont>

## Long forms

When people access a form, it can be daunting to be shown a large number of fields.

While too long depends on the audience and context, there are several ways to make long forms easier
for people:

- break them up into multiple steps
- use progressive disclosure

### Multi-step forms

You can spread form fields across more than one screen using a
[progress tracker](/components/progress-tracker).

In multi-step forms, each screen should show fields that belong together. Make sure people know
their status at each step of a form, and make sure their progress is saved.

### Progressive disclosure

You can configure a form to show more content as users go through the form and use its fields and
controls.

Use this technique when it isn’t necessary to see all controls unless users have made specific
decisions, for example, if they ticked a particular checkbox additional information would be
revealed.

## Validation and error messages

Use validation and error messages to indicate when a form or field submission fails or requires
additional information to be shown.

![Form validation example showing error messaging placement below each field and the use of red to highlight an unfocused text field that needs an entry.](../images/form-validation.png)

1. Unfocused text field
2. Error message and icon
3. Focused text field

The focus color changes to blue when a user selects the text field and starts typing or changes
content.

When validating text fields in real-time, message icons will switch depending on the message type.
For example, helper text changes into an error message when the content being input doesn't fit the
criteria. Error and warning messages disappear when the criteria is met.
