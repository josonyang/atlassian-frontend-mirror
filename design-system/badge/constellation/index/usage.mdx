## Usage

Badges are usually placed before or after the label of the thing they're quantifying, such as the
number of votes for a Jira story. They should only be used to represent a number, however, some
letters and special characters can be used to represent number values, such as `+`, `-`, `K`. For
example:

## Accessibility

- Use badges in conjunction with a single item or label, to avoid ambiguity around which item is
  being quantified.
- Don't rely on color alone to signify whether a value is positive or negative.
- Number values are grouped and separated differently in many countries and regions. Use your app's
  internationalization library, or the browser's internationalization with the user's locale set
  correctly so that number values show in a familiar format.

## Best practices

- Badges should include [tooltips](/components/tooltip), where necessary, to enhance user
  understanding. For example, a badge is used in conjunction with an icon.

## Data Center apps

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
