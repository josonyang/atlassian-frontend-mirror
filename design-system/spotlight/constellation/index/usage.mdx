## Usage

A spotlight focuses attention on a specific part of the UI, such as a button or icon, to educate
users about key features or workflows. Spotlights are most effective for onboarding new users,
driving feature discovery, or highlighting important changes. Use them sparingly — if your UI needs
frequent spotlights, consider simplifying the core experience instead.

## Spotlight Scenarios

### Top use cases

- **Onboarding new users**: Guide first-time users to essential features and workflows.
- **Feature discovery**: Help existing users learn about new or updated capabilities.

### Growth use cases

- **Cross-flow, cross-join, co-use**: Use spotlights only when triggered by another message type
  (e.g., a banner that asks for permission to “show me” before triggering a spotlight).

### Unsupported use cases

- **Transactional**: Never use spotlights for transactional messages.

## Guiding Principles

- **Use sparingly**: Spotlights are a Level 3 (Neutral Plus) attention component. Overuse can
  distract and fatigue users.
- **One at a time**: Only show one spotlight at a time.
- **Dismissibility**: Always provide a dismiss option. Never force participation.
- **Step count**: Prefer single-step spotlights. For tours, keep flows short (2–3 steps max).
- **Orchestration**: Build spotlights with Post Office to avoid message collisions and enforce
  fatigue rules (Atlassians Only).
- **Media**: Use media (images or video) only when it enhances understanding. Exclude media if the
  spotlight already focuses attention effectively.

## Visual Guidance

- **Complexity**: Match the visual complexity to the feature’s learning curve. Use text-only for
  simple features, a single illustration for moderate complexity, and a narrative/motion for complex
  flows.

- **Brand color**: Use solid backgrounds to focus attention. Limit to three brand colors per
  composition.

- **Composition**: Highlight the focal point with size, color, and gesture lines. Use motion only if
  it clarifies the feature.

## Behavior

- **Entry points**: Spotlights should be triggered contextually and never interrupt core workflows.
  For cross-product or promotional spotlights, use a less obtrusive entrypoint (like a banner)
  first.

- **Tours**: Sequence steps logically. Keep flows short and focused.

## Best Practices

- Use spotlights only when necessary to drive understanding or adoption.
- Sequence multi-step spotlights logically; aim for 2–3 steps max.
- Always allow users to dismiss or skip.
- Avoid competing with other in-product messages.
- Prefer embedded, contextual education over overlays.

## Accessibility

- The headline is used as the accessible name for the spotlight dialog.
- Keep content concise and avoid motion that could be disruptive.
- Ensure the carat and spotlight are not truncated by the browser bounds.

## Content Guidelines

## Headline

- Required. Begin with an active verb where possible.
- Brief and direct; communicate the main benefit.
- Limit to one line and use sentence case.

## Body

- Required. Briefly elaborate on the intent.
- Avoid repeating the headline verb.
- Two lines max. Focus on benefits and relevance.
- Reference only visible elements.

## CTA

- Required. One clear next action.
- Avoid plan or feature names in CTAs.
- For tours: “Next”, “Back”, “Done”.
- For features: 1–3 words; “Done” is acceptable if no clear next action.
