## Single Step

Ideally, spotlights should only have a single step so as not to overwhelm users with too much
information. Try and combine or eliminate tasks where possible. Dismiss functionality is required.
Don't force users to participate.

By design `@atlaskit/spotlight` does not have a blanket, scroll-lock, focus-trap, or click-outside
to dismiss functionality. This is to ensure the user is not hijacked into the spotlight experience,
and can opt-in if they are interested.

To show/hide the `SpotlightCard`, simply use a `useState` to control the `isVisible` prop on
`PopoverContent`. To position the `SpotlightCard`, use `PopoverProvider`, `PopoverTarget` and
`PopoverContent` and set the `placement` prop.

<Example Component={SingleStepExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Multiple Steps/Tour

Multiple steps should be avoided if possible. Try and combine or eliminate steps where possible. If
multiple steps are required, preference managing the tour with a `useState`. As a last resort a
React context may be used. However, these contexts will often need to be wrapping the entire `App`
and therefore will cause the entire `App` to re-render every time a new spotlight step is shown.

<Example Component={MultipleStepsExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Placements

Spotlight placements are static. They do not change as the user scrolls, or if the `PopoverContent`
overflows out of the viewport. Make sure to choose a placement that ensures the `SpotlightCard` is
displayed in full.

<Example Component={PlacementsExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Media

Media is optional for a `SpotlightCard`. However if it is used it must be 295px width X 135px
height. This is to ensure correct reflow on smaller viewports.

Media can be an image, video, animation, or any other visual aid to communicate spotlight intent.

<Example Component={MediaExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spinner" />

## Controls

`SpotlightDismissControl` is required for all `SpotlightCard` components. It **must** be the first
focusable element on the `SpotlightCard` card to provide an accessible experience.
