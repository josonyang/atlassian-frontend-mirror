## Basic

Grids are composed of a container `Grid` and child `GridItem`s. These two elements work together to form the grid.

<Example Component={Grid} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Grid width

You can restrict the width of the Grid to pre-defined sizes.  The default value is `fluid`.

### fluid

The Grid takes all available space.

<Example Component={GridFluid} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### narrow

The Grid's maximum width is `744px`.  On smaller screens it will take up all available width.

<Example Component={GridNarrow} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### wide

The Grid's maximum width is `1128px`.  On smaller screens it will take up all available width.

<Example Component={GridWide} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Item span

Define how many columns an item will span (per-breakpoint).  Defaults to full-width, but lower breakpoints will cascade up as the default value if not set.

⚠️ Cascading will result in weird scenarios as columns change.  `xs=2` will show 2/6 columns in sm and 2/12 columns in md and above.  If you set `sm` you should always set `md`.  If you set `xs` you should always set `sm` and `md` to ensure it works as you expect.

See our [breakpoints](../usage) for details on columns available.

## Item offset starting column

Define the column at which your item will start (per-breakpoint).  Defaults to none, but lower breakpoints will cascade up as the default value if not set.

⚠️ Cascading will result in weird scenarios as columns change.  `xs=2` will start at the 2nd of 6 columns in sm and the 2nd of 12 columns in md and above.  If you set `sm` you should always set `md`.  If you set `xs` you should always set `sm` and `md` to ensure it works as you expect.

See our [breakpoints](../usage) for details on columns available.

<Example Component={ItemOffset} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Nested grids

Grids can be composed together. When a grid is composed only the root grid applies margin. This means
that the whitespace of the inner grid will match the whitespace of the outer grid.

<Example Component={NestedGrid} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />
