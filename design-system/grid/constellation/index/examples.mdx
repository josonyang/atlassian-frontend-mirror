## Basic

Grids are composed of a container `Grid` and child `GridItem`s. These two elements work together to form the grid.

<Example Component={Grid} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Grid maxWidth

You can restrict the maxWidth of the Grid to pre-defined sizes. By default, the Grid takes up full space available.

### narrow

The Grid's maximum width is `744px`. On smaller screens it will take up all available width.

<Example Component={GridNarrow} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### wide

The Grid's maximum width is `1128px`. On smaller screens it will take up all available width.

<Example Component={GridWide} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Grid inline padding

By default, the Grid has an inline padding around the outside of the Grid columns. This can be disabled with `hasInlinePadding={false}`

<Example Component={GridInlinePadding} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Item span

Define how many columns an item will span. This is a 1-indexed range 1-12.

By default, span is `12` and will span the entire row.

We enable a shorthand here, using `span={6}` is the same as `span={{ xxs: 6 }}`. The shorthand will override the default full-width functionality across all breakpoints.

See [usage](./usage) to understand our how responsive object syntax works.

<Example Component={ItemSpan} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### Hide an item entirely

In the case that you do not want a GridItem rendered at all, use `span="none"` or `span={{ xxs: 'none', md: 6 }}` (etc).

This is useful because if you wanted to hide the inner contents of the GridItem, the GridItem would still take up the space it's alloted.

<Example Component={ItemHidden} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Item start column

Define the column at which your item will start. This is a 1-indexed range 1-12.

By default, start is `'auto'` and will fill the next available column in the row, as space is available.

We enable a shorthand here, using `start={1}` is the same as `start={{ xxs: 1 }}`. The shorthand will override the default `'auto'` functionality across all breakpoints.

See [usage](./usage) to understand our how responsive object syntax works.

<Example Component={ItemStart} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### Auto positioning

`'auto'` is the default which will fill the next available column in the row, as space is available.

This may be required though to reset the functionality back to default when using the responsive object syntax due to the cascading nature.

<Example Component={ItemStartAuto} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### Position with an offset

If there's room to fill a column, using `start` will stay on the same row, where possible.

<Example Component={ItemStartSameLine} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

### Forced to a new row

With `start`, you can force a GridItem to a new row by setting `start={1}`.

This is because whenever a column is unavailable on the same row subsequently from the previous item, it will always start on the next row at that column instead.

<Example Component={ItemStartNewLine} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Nested grids

We do not support nested Grids at this stage; doing so will throw an error. Further guidance may be provided in the future.

## Grid container

`GridContainer` allows the stacking of independent grids on top of each other.

Functionaly, it is a grid that has a single fluid column with the same responsive gutter as `Grid`. This allows the stacking of multiple independent grids whilst keeping the vertical rhythm enforced by Grid's responsive gap values.

When within `GridContainer` all `Grid` instances are configured to fill their `GridContainer's` width, whilst also disabling inline padding.

In that case, the `hasInlinePadding` and `maxWidth` props should be set in the `GridContainer` instead, ignoring them in `Grid`.

<Example Component={GridContainer} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />
