import { BreakpointsTable } from '../usage/breakpoints-table';

## Usage

See [the grid foundations](/foundations/grid-new) page for more information and guidance.

### Breakpoints

We have pre-configured breakpoints which the `GridItem`'s `span` and `start` props are built around.

These breakpoints also modify the gutter between columns and the `Grid`'s outer margins.

<BreakpointsTable />

### Cascading Responsive Objects

The `GridItem`'s `span` and `start` props use objects to define the responsiveness.

- The defined configuration will cascade upwards from `xxs` through `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` to `xl`.
  So if you define `<GridItem span={{ xxs: 4 }}>`, this is equal to
  `<GridItem span={{ xxs: 4, xs: 4, sm: 4, md: 4, lg: 4, xl: 4 }}>`.
- When a higher breakpoint is set, it will override, eg. `<GridItem span={{ xxs: 6, md: 4 }}>` is
  equal to `<GridItem span={{ xxs: 6, xs: 6, sm:6, md: 4, lg: 4, xl: 4 }}>`.
- You can happily skip breakpoints if you're comfortable using the default values for lower
  breakpoints, eg. `<GridItem span={{ md: 6 }}>` will use the default of 12 (full-width) value until
  `md`, then span 6 columns.

**There is a shorthand for these objects**, eg. `<GridItem span={4}>` is the same as
`<GridItem span={{ xxs: 4 }}>`â€”affecting all breakpoints.
