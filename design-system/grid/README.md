# Grid

A grid component is a layout tool that facilitates the arrangement of content in a grid format, providing a consistent structure and allowing for easy customization of column and row sizes.

## Release stage: Alpha

This package is an experiment. We may make frequent breaking changes with limited notice, and this may be removed if testing goes poorly. We don't recommend using this without support from our team.

## Installation
