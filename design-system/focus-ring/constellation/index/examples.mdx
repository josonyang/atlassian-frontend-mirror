## Default

A focus ring indicates the currently focused item. The default focus ring shows a line around the
outside of the focused item.

<Example Component={FocusRingDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/focus-ring" />

## Inset line

You can toggle the focus ring to show inside the focused item. This is for cases when an inset line
is more visible than the default line or to avoid overlapping other UI.

<Example Component={FocusRingInset} packageName="@atlaskit/focus-ring" />
