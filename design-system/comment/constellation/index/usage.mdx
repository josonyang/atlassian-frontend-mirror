## Usage

Use the comment component to let people give feedback or have discussions on a particular page, task
or project.

## Accessibility

Including headings with comments is recommended. Use the `headingLevel` prop to configure the
heading level. The default heading has an `h3` tag. Make sure that headings are in the correct order
and donâ€™t skip levels. For example, an `h3` comment should follow an `h2` section heading, or
another `h3` comment, but never an `h1`.

## Behavior

You can configure the comment component to show extra information and features:

- Comments can be restricted so that only a specific group of people can view or reply. This is
  represented by a lock icon.
- You can use lozenges to help people identify the type of comment. For example, when the comment
  comes from an author, or an external user.
- Actions below the comment help people interact. For example, "Reply", "Edit", or "Like".
- You can show if the comment has been edited. This is recommended when offering an edit feature.

### Nesting comments

Comment threads can be flat or nested.

- Use flat comments sections for areas where the conversation is likely to be short and focused.
- Use nested comments when broad discussions can happen among multiple participants, and people are
  more likely to need to differentiate between conversation threads.

### Localization

Ensure that the locale is appropriately set so that people see dates and times in a familiar format.
