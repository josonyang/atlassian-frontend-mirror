## Usage

The `Image` component can be used interchangeably with the native `img` element. The key difference at this stage is the `Image` component's awareness of themes.

## Best practices

- Use the `Image` component when your image requires different sources for light and dark modes.

- Avoid applying css directly to `Image`. This is not supported, and will be deprecated in favor of `xcss` in future. In most cases it should be possible to apply styling to a containing element instead.
