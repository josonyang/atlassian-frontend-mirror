import ImageThemed from '../../examples/constellation/image-themed';

## Appearance

### Default

Works exactly like a native `img` element. It recognizes and accepts all `img` props, but future versions will have more limitations and not include unsafe props like `className` and `css`.

<Example Component={ImageDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/image" />

### Dark mode

Provide a dark mode image source with `srcDark`. When provided, `srcDark` will automatically be displayed when in dark mode and `src` in all other cases. If a theme hasn't been explicitly selected by the user, the `Image` component will also check for operating system preferences.

<Example Component={ImageThemed} packageName="@atlaskit/image" />
