## Usage

The inline message is a notification that you can use in-context to give people more information, a
warning, an error message, or a confirmation.

People can interact with the icon, title or secondary text to reveal the full inline message. When
the message is triggered, an [popup](/components/popup) appears providing further context on the
issue and links to information or actions.

## Anatomy

![The example inline message is "Log in to find out about Portfolio for Jira". It has an "information" theme and icon.](images/inline-message-anatomy.png)

1. **Icon:** Indicates the status of the message. The icon's color and symbol give a quick visual
   indicator of the type and urgency of the message.
2. **Title (optional):** Should be concise and bolded when in use.
3. **Message:** Use regular text for the message body. The message is restricted to five lines in
   length.

## Accessibility

- Avoid writing messages longer than five lines. If the text overflows, the message body will be
  truncated with an ellipsis, which is not accessible.
- We recommend including a title with the inline message. While you can create inline messages with
  icons alone, these may be easily missed.
- Use `iconLabel` to provide an accessible label if the inline message doesn't have a title, or if
  the icon adds additional context. For example, when the icon conveys an error.

## Content guidelines

### Warning

Warning messages appear before we ask people to take action. This is usually in anticipation of a
significant change. Have empathy for the user. Inform, but don't alarm. If the warning comes before
an action, clearly communicate what will happen if they proceed, and provide an alternative where
possible.

- Make sure you're not talking about something that has already occurred (this should be an error
  message instead).
- For authentication messages include a link that describes the appropriate action if available.
  Keep the message short and only include relevant information.

### Error

Explain the problem and provide people with a next step or an alternative. Keep the message simple
and direct, and avoid confusing people with technical details.

- Avoid blame and accept if something is our fault - "we're having trouble connecting" rather than
  "you're having connection issues."
- Let people know what's causing the error, rather than writing a general error message that works
  for a number of things.

### Confirmation

For these messages, it's best to confirm the outcome then get out of the way. If something has just
been created, give people an option to view it. If the message occurs frequently, keep it concise.
Bigger, more infrequent messages can be celebratory and playful.

### Information

Information messages alert people to additional information without requiring an action. Inform
people about something that might help or impact them. Then, let them get back to work.

## Related

- For confirmations, alerts, and acknowledgments that require minimal interaction, use a
  [flag](/components/flag).
- For critical system-level messaging (warnings and errors) about loss of data or functionality use
  a [banner](/components/banner).
