This is a fork of the code in `services/design-system-docs/src/__DO_NOT_ADD_TO_THIS_FOLDER__/gatsby-theme-brisk/components/props.tsx`.

Extracting this into a shared module proved much harder than expected. Also, the UI differences between DS Docs and Atlaskit docs are significant (e.g. Heading styles). Hence, this fork was the least-worst option.
