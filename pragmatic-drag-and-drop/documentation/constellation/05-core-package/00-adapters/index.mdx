An _adapter_ teaches Pragmatic drag and drop how to handle dragging a particular entity type:

- [element adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/adapters/element) → handling
  the dragging of draggable elements
- [text selection adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/adapters/text-selection)
  → handling the dragging of text selections
- [external adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/adapters/external) → handling
  drag operations that started outside of the current `window` (eg files and text from other
  `window`s or applications)
