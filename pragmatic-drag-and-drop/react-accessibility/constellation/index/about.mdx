<SectionMessage>

This package depends on:

- [the core package](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package)
- [`react`](https://react.dev/)
- [`@emotion/react`](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling
- Some Atlassian Design System packages

<br />

You are welcome to reimplement this (small) package using your own tech stack.

</SectionMessage>

<SectionMessage title="React 19" appearance='information'>

We expect this package to work with React 19 and have included it in the supported peer dependency
range.

We do not currently test against React 19 directly, so there is a small risk of issues. If you have
any problems, please raise an issue on
[Github](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop) and we can look into it.
