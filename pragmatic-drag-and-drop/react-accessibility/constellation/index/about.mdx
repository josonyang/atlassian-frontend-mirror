import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

This package provides some optional `react` components that can be used to build
alternative flows for accessibility.

<SectionMessage>

This package depends on:

- [the core package](/components/drag-and-drop/core-package)
- [`react`](https://react.dev/)
- [`@emotion/react`](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling
- Some Atlassian Design System packages

<br />

You are welcome to reimplement this (small) package using your own tech stack.
