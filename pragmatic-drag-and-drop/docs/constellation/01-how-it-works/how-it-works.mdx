**Pragmatic drag and drop is currently in early access release. Expect frequent changes.** <br/>
We'll clearly communicate API changes made during the early access phase, but we won't provide automated change tooling until we hit stable versions 1.0+.

Read this page to understand the pieces of Pragmatic drag and drop and how to use them.


## How Pragmatic drag and drop works

Pragmatic drag and drop is made of adapters, drop targets, and monitors.

- Adapters control dragging different types of objects, like files or text. These come with the core Pragmatic drag and drop library. These also include monitors and events to listen and respond to  different parts of the dragging and dropping experience.

### Adapters

A drag adapter teaches `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` how to handle dragging a particular entity, such as [elements](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/adapters/element-adapter), [external files](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/adapters/file-adapter), or text.

A drag adapter always provides at least two pieces:

1. A way of registering _drop target_ (eg `dropTargetForElements`).
2. A way to create a _monitor_ (eg `monitorForFiles`).

```ts
import {
  dropTargetForFiles,
  monitorForFiles,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/file';

import {
  dropTargetForElements,
  monitorForElements,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';
```

A drag adapter can also provide additional pieces. For example, the [element adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/adapters/element-adapter) provides a `draggable` function which is a way of registering an `Element` as being draggable.

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = draggable({
  element: myElement,
});
```
When you use a drag adapter, you'll bring in the code required for that entity and no more. For example, if you use the element adapter, your application won't include any code for handling files.

Learn more about [adapters](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/adapters).


### Drop targets

An `Element` that can be dropped upon by something that is dragging.

```ts
import { dropTargetForFiles } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/file';

const cleanup = dropTargetForFiles({
  element: myElement,
});
```

Learn more about [drop targets](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/drop-targets).

### Monitors

A way of listening for `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` drag operation events anywhere.

```ts
import { monitorForElements } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  element: myElement,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('an element started dragging'),
});
```
Learn more about [monitors](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/monitors).

### Addons

An addon piece of code that impacts the control flow of your drag operation (for example, the [hitbox detection addon](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/hitbox)) or performs some side effect during the drag operation (like the [auto scroller addon](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/autoscroll)).

```ts
import { autoScroller } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-autoscroll';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  onDragStart: ({ location }) => {
    autoScroller.start({ input: location.current.input });
  },
  onDrop: () => {
    autoScroller.stop();
  },
  onDrag: ({ location }) => {
    autoScroller.updateInput({
      input: location.current.input,
    });
  },
});
```

### Utilities

Utilities are small helper functions for common , which are included with the main drag and drop package (e.g. `once` for simple memoization, or `combine` to collapse cleanup functions).

```ts
import { combine } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/combine';

const cleanup = combine(
  draggable({
    element: myElement,
  }),
  dropTarget({
    element: myElement,
  }),
);
```
