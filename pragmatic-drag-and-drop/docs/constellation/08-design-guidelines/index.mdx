These guidelines provide an opinionated way to implement drag and drop experiences with Pragmatic drag and drop for Atlassian interfaces. Non-Atlassian consumers are welcome to use these guidelines, or create their own visual language for drag and drop. The [core package](./core-package) does not have any baked in design opinions, but some of the [optional packages](./optional-packages) embody these design choices.

Cards, lists, and other UI can often be dragged and reordered. Design clear and consistent drag and drop experiences in Atlassian products following these principles:

- [Show what is draggable](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines#show-what-is-draggable)
- [Use previews and drop indicators during dragging](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines#use-clear-previews-and-drop-indicators-during-dragging)
  - [Multiple item drag previews](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines#multiple-item-drag-previews)
- [Show the item in its new location](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines#show-the-item-in-its-new-position)
- [Provide keyboard-accessible ways to move items](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines#provide-accessible-controls)
- [Follow examples and specs for cards, lists, and trees](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines#examples-of-multi-item-select-drag-and-drop)

## Show what is draggable

Use background colors, cursor changes, and icons to show what can be dragged. Choose the affordances based on on type of object and how important dragging is to the experience.

### Hover states and cursor changes

Some experiences, such cards in a board, imply that items can be dragged. Use background or border color changes on hover to show that items are interactive.

Combine hover background color changes with a change to the grab cursor to show that items can be moved. If the item has other interactions, you can delay the grab cursor till `800ms`.

![A board of cards that can be dragged between columns. The cursor shows a hand grabbing a card where the background-color changes on hover.](/images/design-cards-draggable.png)

Implement with [design tokens](/components/tokens/) and [cursors](../how-it-works/drop-targets/cursors) in code, or use the [Figma kit (Atlassian only)](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-2098&mode=design>) for designs.

### Drag handle icons

When dragging is the main action in your experience, show the drag handle icon on the left of the draggable items at all times. If dragging is possible, but not the main task, only show the drag handle icon on hover to simplify.

Drag icons help users understand what is draggable. Lists, editable table items, or other items that aren't always draggable may need the additional affordance of a drag handle icon.

![Cards in a view where dragging is the main action. Each has a drag handle icon on the left of the card.](/images/design-config-cards-handles.png)

In general, make the whole item draggable wherever possible. If the item has lots of interactive parts, such as buttons or links on top of the item, you can also make the drag handle itself the only part that allows grab and drag interactions.

Use the [drag handle component](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/react-accessibility/drag-handle-button/examples) in code or [drag handles in Figma (Atlassian only)](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38%3A5623&mode=design&t=LsTwhMGxMe6t08K3-1>) for designs.

## Use clear previews and drop indicators during dragging

While an item is being dragged, A drag preview should move along with the cursor during the drag. The original item should stay in place and dim to 40% opacity while the drag preview is in progress.

### Drag previews

Try to keep previews under`280px`. Some Windows versions add transparency to previews larger than `280px` to avoid blocking other objects on screen.

List items and smaller elements offset the preview from the cursor by `space.200` horizontally and `space.100` vertically. Cards and larger elements are dragged from the point they’re grabbed (no offset).

![A small list of items being dragged across a screen. The items appear near the cursor, slightly offset to the right](/images/design-multi-preview-small-list.png)

For best performance, implement with [native drag previews](../how-it-works/adapters/element-adapter#drag-previews), or use the [Figma kit (Atlassian only)](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-5065&mode=design>) in designs.

### Multiple-item drag previews

For multi-item drag previews, use a stacked appearance with a badge indicating the number of items being dragged.

- **Four or more small items** such as list items should appear as a stacked preview under the first item. Less than four small items can appear separately where space allows (all items showing in the preview).
- **Any more than one large item** (card) should show as a stack with a badge indicating the number underneath.

![A stack of multiple cards being dragged across a board, with a badge indicating there are two cards being moved.](/images/design-multi-card-drag.png)

Implement with [native drag previews](../how-it-works/adapters/element-adapter#drag-previews), or use the [Figma kit (Atlassian only)](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-5065&mode=design>) in designs.

### Drop placement indicators

To show where the item being dragged will land, use a drop line indicator with a terminal circle. The circle should overlap the far left of the element container where possible. For stacked items, the line should appear in the middle of the gap between the items.

![A list of items where one is being dragged over a new location. The location where the item would drop if released is marked with a blue line and dot. ](/images/design-list-drop-indicator.png)

[Edge detection](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/react-indicator/about#edge) determines when and where the drop indicator shows based on the location of the dragged item.

To achieve this, use the [react indicator](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/react-indicator/about) in code or the [Figma kit indicator](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-5065&mode=desig>) in designs.

## Show the item in its new position

After drop, the preview disappears and the original item moves to the new location. Use `color.background.selected` to flash once the element has been dropped.

![A series of actions shown in four slides. Hover state is grey, the drag indicator appears once drag begins, upon drop the color of the item flashes blue, then returns to its normal color.](/images/design-drop-flash.png)

Implement this using [flourish](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/flourish/code) in code or show the color in the [Figma kit](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-5065&mode=design>) for designs.

## Provide accessible controls

When making accessible controls for drag and drop experiences, add visible drag handle icons to all draggable items (where possible).

### Action menus for move actions

If the item already has a more actions (…) menu, put the move actions inside of the menu. This provides a keyboard accessible way to move items that doesn’t rely on mouse clicking and dragging.

![A Jira issue list view where a more actions button appears on the items. The button has three dots as a label ...](/images/design-more-actions-hover.png)

### Drag handle icon menus for move actions

If the entity does not have any more actions (…), make the drag handle icon into a menu button. When triggered, the drag handle button opens a menu that allows the users to move the item.

![An issue details view in Jira. A drag handle icon appears at the left of the assignee field. It is focussable, and opens a menu with options to move the field up or down in the view.](/images/design-drag-handle-menu.png)

Use the [drag handle menu component](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/react-accessibility/drag-handle-dropdown-menu/examples) in code or the [Figma kit drag handle menu](<https://www.figma.com/file/3E3rGPX4YHlVUP3cNyRykB/Pragmatic-Drag-%26-Drop-UI-Kit-(PDND)?type=design&node-id=38-2098&mode=design>) in designs.

### Other alternative controls

If drag handles aren't always visible, provide ways to access movement controls on focus.

![A series of actions that allow users to focus on a group of items, then move or rearrange them. ](/images/desin-edit-order-alt.png)

## Examples of multi-item select, drag, and drop

How to show when more than one element is selected to be dragged.

### Cards and boards

Use `color.background.selected` and `color.border.selected` to show the elements that have been selected, then change to the typical background color at 40% opacity once dragging begins. This shows where the objects are currently, and where they'll return if no drag location is chosen.

Because cards are larger, multiple cards should be stacked under the first card in the preview. Use a badge to show how many items are being moved.

![A stack of multiple cards being dragged across a board, with a badge indicating there are two cards being moved.](/images/design-multi-card-drag.png)

Checkboxes are highly recommended to show when one or more items are selected.

<!-- TODO Fix example to match ideal design guide -->
<!-- TODO uncomment this once example is done:
Try selecting and dragging multiple cards in the board below for an example. -->

<!-- <Example Component={BoardExample} appearance="showcase-only" /> -->

### List items

Use the selected background color token to indicate which items have been selected. Use drag previews as usual, with all items being dragged in a column in the order they’d appear when dropped.

![A list of draggable items where some are selected, shown in blue.](/images/design-multi-select-list.png)

For more than three or four items, show a badge indicating the number and an implied stack beneath the top item.
