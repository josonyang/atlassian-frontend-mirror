description: Techniques to get even better performance out of Pragmatic drag and drop.
---

Given Pragmatic drag and drop is tiny, you already get great performance simply by using the library. For some use cases, you can unlock greater performance gains with techniques like deferred loading or virtualization.

## Deferred loading

If you want to, you can defer the loading of Pragmatic drag and drop (and other packages) at a point after initial page load using _dynamic imports_.

Deferring the loading of drag and drop behavior has some advantages:

- Faster initial page loads
- The ability to load in drag and drop behavior when it is needed, rather than in the critical bundle

There are also some drawbacks:

- Additional complexity as you are no longer simply importing a module and using it.
- _Potential_ to miss an interaction: if a user starts trying to drag before `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` is loaded, then the user would not be able to perform a drag operation. You can add some instrumentation to detect when these 'misses' occur. In our initial observations we have found the 'readiness' gap to be extremely small.

## Virtualization

Virtualization (or "windowing") is a technique where you only render what is visible to the user. Virtualization is a powerful way to improve performance for large data sets.

Key things to keep in mind:

- With virtual solutions, elements (and components) can be added removed during a drag.
- Elements being dragged can be removed when they are offscreen.
- `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` entities that are destroyed during a drag will no longe recieve events.
- Native events (eg `"dragend"`) are dispatched on relevant elements; which can be problematic when those relevant elements are perminately removed during a drag.
