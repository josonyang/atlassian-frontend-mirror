Alternative flows enable people using assistive technologies to achieve the same outcomes as pointer based drag and drop operations. The goal is to enable the same outcomes as drag and drop operations (eg "move an item to another list"), but using assistive technology friendly controls and practices.

When building alternative flows, there are a few important pieces to consider:

- **Adding accessible controls**: Allow users to trigger operations using standard controls that are assistive technology friendly.

If an operation is completed with an accessible control, you then need to:

- **Announce**: tell users what happened by announcing it to screen readers; and
- **Restore focus**: restore focus to the element that just moved so that the user can quickly make further actions

## Enable operations: Accessible controls

Keyboard users and users of assistive technology must be able to achieve the same outcomes without pointer based drag and drop operations. This should be achieved by providing standard controls that are usable by assistive technology.

This page covers patterns for common use cases. You are welcome to deviate from these patterns if it makes sense in your context, but please ensure that users can still achieve all outcomes without pointer based drag and drop operations.

### Action menu button

Display an action menu button on a draggable entity. When the button is pressed, then a mechanism is displayed to allow users to achieve outcomes is revealed.

#### Inline dialog

For simple outcomes, you can use an inline menu (eg "move down")

Using a **drag handle menu** _(more details below)_

<Example Component={ListExample} />

Using a **meatball menu** _(more details below)_

<Example Component={BoardExample} />

#### Modal dialog

For outcomes that require additional input (eg "which column should this card move to?"), then you can have the action menu trigger the display of a form, inside of a modal dialog.

This pattern is used in our tree example. Each tree item has a button which opens a modal dialog with a form for moving the item. The form consists of two select fields: one for selecting a parent item, and one for selecting a position within that parent.

<Example Component={TreeExample} />

### Drag handle menu

<SectionMessage title="Preferred approach">

This pattern is the preferred approach for providing alternative flows and
should be used where possible.

</SectionMessage>

When a drag handle icon is displayed, we can also make that icon a button to trigger the display of a mechanism for users to select outcomes.

The drag handle menu can be used to trigger an action menu or modal (see below).

For experiences where drag and drop is a common or important action, ensure that the drag handle is always visible for added visual clarity. Otherwise, you may choose to only show the drag handle on hover and focus.

We have created an [optional convenience package](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/react-accessibility/about)
for creating drag handle buttons in React using the Atlassian Design System. This includes a plain drag handle button, as well as a drag handle with a dropdown menu already wired up. If you are not using the Atlassian Design System, you are welcome to borrow the principle and implement it yourself.

This pattern is used in our list example. Each list item has a drag handle that also functions as an action menu.

<Example Component={ListExample} />

### Meatball menu

Some items will not have a drag handle, either because:

- There is a different affordance indicating that the item is draggable.
- The component layout cannot accommodate a drag handle.

Use a meatball menu in these situations. It does not need to be specific to
movement actions, and movement actions can be integrated into existing meatball menus.

This pattern is used in our board example. Each card and and column has an action menu which provides all of the same operations as drag and drop.

<Example Component={BoardExample} />

## Post operation: Announce

If a user achieves an outcome using an accessible control, we need to tell the user what occurred by announcing the outcome of the operation to a screen reader. We announce things to the user by using an invisible live region element. The content of a live region is announced by screen readers, even if the live region does not have focus. Changing the content of a live region results in a new announcement.

Live region announcements are important for users that cannot see. Sighted users are aware of content visually changing, but unsighted users are not. By using live regions, we can communicate content changes to assistive technology.

Live regions are created by applying the `aria-live` attribute to an element. We have created a [utility package for making live region announcements](../packages/live-region).

```ts
import * as liveRegion from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-live-region';

function onReorderItem({
  item,
  startIndex,
  newIndex,
}: {
  item: { label: string };
  startIndex: number;
  newIndex: number;
}) {
  // reorder item in state to update UI

  // let screen reader users know what has occurred
  liveRegion.announce(
    `You've moved ${item.label} from position ${startIndex + 1} to position ${
      newIndex + 1
    } of ${items.length}.`,
  );
}
```

## Post operation: Restore focus

If an element moved on the page using an accessible control, it is important that the element be given focus after the operation is complete. This enables users to continue to engage with the element they just moved without having to go searching for it.

Reordering elements with React does not typically require manual focus restoration as React will generally take care of this. However, if the element is reparented (such as when moving between columns) it will require manual focus restoration.

<SectionMessage appearance="warning" title="For non-react consumers">

When reordering elements on the web, it is not guaranteed that focus is maintained on the original item. If you are not using React, it is important to check if your view library maintains focus on items when reordering. If it does not, then you will need to do _manual focus restoration_ for when reordering.

</SectionMessage>

### Automatic focus restoration

In our list example, items can be reordered within the same list. When an item is moved through the action menu button, focus remains on the drag handle button for that item without us needing to do anything. React is shifting the element and is ensuring that focus is maintained for us.

<Example Component={ListExample} />

### Manual focus restoration

In this example, the avatar can be moved between the two columns by dragging or by pressing the 'swap team' button. If the button has focus when it is selected (by pointer or by keyboard) focus is restored to it after moving.

Manual focus restoration is required because the button is being reparented, and so will remount. The button in the new column is not the same DOM element as the original button, so focus cannot be automatically preserved.

<Example Component={ManualFocusRestorationExample} />
