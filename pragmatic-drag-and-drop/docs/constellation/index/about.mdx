Pragmatic drag and drop is here to help you build fast and intuitive drag and drop experiences, such as dragging cards on a page, file uploads, table rows, and more.

This light-weight framework uses the browser's drag and drop API to power experiences, improving page performance and package sizes. Customize your experience with addons for changes to basic feel, accessibility flows, and other utilities as needed.

**Pragmatic drag and drop is currently in early access release. Expect frequent changes.** <br/>

## Common terms

These are some of the terms you'll see used to refer to particular entities:

- **Drag source**: The entity that is dragging. These can be internal to a page (a `draggable` from the [element adapter](/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/adapters/element-adapter)) or external [file adapter](/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/how-it-works/adapters/file-adapter))
- **Drag preview**: The thing that a user drags around. For elements, this is generally a picture of the drag source (a `draggable` element)
- **Drop indicator**: Something that is drawn to indicate where the drag source will be dropped (generally a line). You are free to draw your own drop indicators. We also have a package of premade ones: `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-indicator`.
