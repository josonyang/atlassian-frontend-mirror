Drag and drop interactions rely on pointer-only only gestures that not everybody can operate. For all drag and drop interactions powered by Pragmatic drag and drop we encourage the use of alternative mechanisms that provide a straightforward way for users of assistive technologies to achieve the same outcomes as a drag and drop interaction ("alternative flows").

Alternative flows should allow users to complete tasks without using dragging gestures. The structure of alternative flows do not have to mirror drag and drop flows, as long as they enable users to achieve the same outcomes.

Pragmatic drag and drop does not bake in accessibility controls as there is no one size fits all pattern that works well for all situations. We provide you with guidance and a toolchain to help you quickly wire up highly accessible, and low cost, alternative flows.

<SectionMessage>

Our approach of leveraging alternative flows for assistive technologies satisfies [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 - 2.5.7 Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dragging-movements)

## Accessibility with alternative flows

Pragmatic drag and drop is powered by the browser drag and drop API, which has no built-in accessibility story. To ensure that your experience is accessible, you must create alternative flows.

Designers working on experiences with drag and drop interactions should specify alternative flows that are not reliant on dragging gestures. These flows can be tailored to the specific type of interaction that drag and drop is being used for.

There is no universal alternative flow that will work for all experiences. Use the following guidelines and tooling to help you make accessible drag and drop experiences:

### Offer alternatives to dragging

Some users find dragging gestures difficult, and others are unable to do them altogether. Ensure that dragging gestures are not required to complete tasks. Users should be able to achieve the same outcomes using pointing input without any dragging.

<DoDont type="do">
  Use drag and drop interactions alongside alternative flows.
</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">
  Restrict task completion to drag and drop interactions.
</DoDont>

See examples of [alternate flows patterns](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/accessibility/patterns).

### Make sure it works with a keyboard

Many users do not interact with pointing input, instead relying on keyboard input. Ensure that pointing input is not required to complete tasks. Users should be able to achieve the same outcomes using only a keyboard.

<DoDont type="do">
  Ensure that keyboard users can achieve the same outcomes as pointing input
  users.
</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">
  Create experiences that keyboard users cannot complete all tasks with.
</DoDont>

### Use standard controls

Native controls like buttons are accessible by default, and common widgets like dropdown menus have straightforward accessibility stories. Use standard controls like these when building alternative flows. This makes it easier to build accessible and familiar experiences.

<DoDont type="do">
  Use accessible and familiar controls to build alternative flows.
</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">
  Use inaccessible controls to build alternative flows.
</DoDont>

### Focus on outcomes

There is no universal design for alternative flows, and the suitability of patterns varies. Focus on the task being completed, not on emulating drag and drop interactions. All users should be able to achieve the same outcomes in an intuitive way.

<DoDont type="do">
  Ensure that all users can complete tasks and achieve the same outcomes.
</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">
  Treat drag and drop interactions as the outcome. They are one way of achieving
  it.
</DoDont>

## Screen readers

Some users interact with their computer using assistive technology such as a screen reader. Screen readers rely on page authors following best practices.

There are two components to making pages perceivable for screen readers:

1. Labels
2. Live region announcements

For general guidelines on writing meaningful text, refer to our [accessibility guidelines](/foundations/accessibility).

### Labels

All interactive elements should have a meaningful name visible to assistive technology.

Ensure that accessible names for buttons include the name of the element being acted on, e.g. “Move task 'clean dishes' to top of backlog”.

<DoDont type="do">Include the name of the element being acted on.</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">Don't make labels ambiguous.</DoDont>

### Live region announcements

Use live regions to announce content changes to screen readers. Messages in live regions will be announced by screen reader.

Live regions should be used to provide real-time feedback both during and after a user interaction. Messages should contain the name of the item being moved, as well as both its old and new position.

<DoDont type="do">Include the name of the element being acted on.</DoDont>

<DoDont type="dont">Don''t make labels ambiguous.</DoDont>

To simplify making live region announcements, we have created a [live region package](API-addons/live-region).
