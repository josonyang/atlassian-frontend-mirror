### Does Pragmatic drag and drop bake in accessibility?

We have made sure that you can use Pragmatic drag and drop to ship extremely accessible experiences. The core library of Pragmatic drag and drop powers pointer based drag and drop operations. Accessibility is added to experiences by adding simple and cheap controls (eg action menus) that make it easy for assistive technology users to achieve the same _outcomes_ as drag and drop operations in a way that does not require pointer based gestures ("alternative flows"). We have done the hard work in building accessible controls to enable alternative flows, all you need to do is to choose and add the controls that make sense for your experience.

The core library of Pragmatic drag and drop powers pointer based drag and drop operations and does not ship with out of the box accessibility controls. Assistive technology support is added to an experience by adding one of our vetted assistive technology friendly controls.

For Atlassian Design System consumers, we hope to start including Pragmatic drag and drop and relevant accessibility controls into our future outputs (eg tables), so that makers don't need to do any additional work to get rich drag interactions, and highly accessible experiences out of the box.

### `react-beautiful-dnd` baked in accessibility, is this a step backwards?

`react-beautiful-dnd` was only designed to power lists and lists of lists. Within that subset of the drag and drop problem space, it was able to provide a keyboard experience out of the box. Pragmatic drag and drop can be used to power _any_ drag and drop experience, and we have found there is no one size fits all solution for accessibility. In order to provide a flexible offerring that can be used to power all experiences, we cannot bake in accessible controls. Baking visible controls into Pragmatic drag and drop (eg action menus) is problematic as Pragmatic drag and drop would then need to take over the rendering of elements, rather than just attaching behaviour to existing elements. Makers will need to select and add in one of our (or their own) accessibily controls along side Pragmatic drag and drop.

The drag and drop problem space is much bigger than just lists and lists of lists. In the past, if you needed to add drag and drop to an experience that was not a list, you would have to find an alternative drag and drop solution, and also solve accessibility on your own. It is now possible for makers to use one drag and drop solution (Pragmatic drag and drop) for all use cases, and with that increased flexibility, also comes some additional selections of and add accessible controls.

With Pragmatic drag and drop, and the patterns we are using around it, we can ship more accessible lists and lists of lists than `react-beautiful-dnd` (see below), and we can also make any other drag and drop interaction accessible as well.

### Why has Pragmatic drag and drop chosen a different keyboard experience to `react-beautiful-dnd`?

`react-beautiful-dnd` enables users to move items around by using a keyboard and a screen reader

`react-beautiful-dnd` has the following keyboard controls:

- <kbd>space</kbd>: lift an item
- Arrow keys: (<kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>→</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>←</kbd>): move an item directionally (can result in reordering, or moving between lists)
- <kbd>space</kbd>: drop an item
- <kbd>escape</kbd>: cancel a drag

One of the best things about `react-beautiful-dnd` is that it thought deeply about how accessibility could work for drag and drop operations.

#### Problems with the `react-beautiful-dnd` pattern

While the `react-beautiful-dnd` keyboard interaction pattern is _okay_, it has some problems:

##### Friction for assistive technology users

- The pattern requires [JAWS screen reader](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) users to change screen reader mode to use it
- Directional arrow movement does not make a lot of sense when you cannot see the interface you are engaging with (eg what would a user expect "left" (<kbd>←</kbd>) to do on an interface they cannot see?)

- `react-beautiful-dnd` provides usage instructions on for drag and drop using the _accessible description_ on drag handles. Providing usage instructions in the description is an accessibility anti-pattern.

##### Limitations

- Directional arrow movement does not work for all experiences (it really only works for lists and lists of lists)
- The pattern does not support moving items between lists along the main axis (eg if two vertical lists are stacked vertically, a keyboard user cannot move items between the lists). Supporting directional movements for all use cases, even for lists, is extremely complex to achieve

##### Poor performance

The pattern requires _a lot_ of code and complexity to get working well, which undercuts the performance we are trying to achieve with Pragmatic drag and drop.

#### We want a better experience for assistive technology users

For Pragmatic drag and drop we want to provide a best in class assisible experience for all use cases. We encourage use of standard controls (eg an "action menu") to enable users of assistive technologies to quickly and easily achieve powerful tasks.

Advantages of this approach:

- We can choose controls that work extremely well with assistive technologies (eg menus, modals, selects and so on)
- We can choose controls that make sense for a given experience (not all experiences have to have the same controls)
- We can choose controls that are cheap and fast for clients
