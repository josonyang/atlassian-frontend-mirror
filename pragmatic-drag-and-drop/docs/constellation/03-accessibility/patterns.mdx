import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

Alternative flows can be implemented in a variety of ways.

For reference, we've collected some patterns for alternative flows. These are not expected to be implemented exactly as shown and can be adapted where necessary.

## Action buttons

<SectionMessage>

This is the pattern we recommend for most use cases.

</SectionMessage>

Each `draggable` item is given an `...` action menu which contains all possible actions for the entity (eg "move issue to in progress", "reorder item below next item", "delete card" and so on).

```ts
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';
import DropdownMenu, {
  DropdownItem,
  DropdownItemGroup,
} from '@atlaskit/dropdown-menu';
import MoreIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/more';
import Tooltip from '@atlaskit/tooltip';

export function CardExample() {
  return (
    <DropdownMenu
      trigger={({ triggerRef, ...triggerProps }) => (
        <Tooltip content="Card actions" position="left">
          <Button
            ref={triggerRef}
            {...triggerProps}
            iconBefore={<MoreIcon label="Card actions" size="small" />}
            spacing="compact"
          />
        </Tooltip>
      )}
    >
      <DropdownItemGroup>
        <DropdownItem isDisabled={isFirstRow} onClick={moveUp}>
          Move up
        </DropdownItem>
        <DropdownItem isDisabled={isLastRow} onClick={moveDown}>
          Move down
        </DropdownItem>
      </DropdownItemGroup>
    </DropdownMenu>
  );
}
```

## Modal dialogs

Modals are an alternative to the `DropDownMenu` approach. Rather than your action button triggering a `DropDownMenu`, your action button can trigger a `Modal`. A `Modal` can be used to to power more complex interactions. For example:

- Interactions that require user input
- Interactions that require multiple choices to be made

## Inline buttons

Buttons can be placed inside draggable items, providing directional input. This is useful for free movement experiences such as diagrams and drawing.

## Toggles

Toggles can be used to show or hide edit controls.

This pattern can be combined with other patterns.

## Select and move

A move mode can be triggered where only drop targets are focusable/clickable.

The item(s) being moved are selected, then an anchor item is chosen. Item(s) are moved above or below the anchor item.
