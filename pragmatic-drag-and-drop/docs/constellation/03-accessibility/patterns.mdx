</SectionMessage>

When it comes to implementing assistive technology friendly mechanisms to achieve the same outcomes as a drag and drop operation ("alternative flows"), there are a few important pieces you will need to add.

1. A assistive technoglogy friendly control to allow users to trigger operations
2. Screen reader messaging after an operation to tell the user what occurred
3. Focus restoration where appropriate

## Controls

Here is a collection of assistive technology friendly controls that can be used to power alternative flows. These are not expected to be implemented exactly as shown and can be adapted where necessary.

### Action buttons

<SectionMessage>

This is the pattern we recommend for most use cases.

</SectionMessage>

Each `draggable` item is given an `...` action menu which contains all possible actions for the entity (eg "move issue to in progress", "reorder item below next item", "delete card" and so on).

```ts
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';
import DropdownMenu, {
  DropdownItem,
  DropdownItemGroup,
} from '@atlaskit/dropdown-menu';
import MoreIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/more';
import Tooltip from '@atlaskit/tooltip';

export function CardExample() {
  return (
    <DropdownMenu
      trigger={({ triggerRef, ...triggerProps }) => (
        <Tooltip content="Card actions" position="left">
          <Button
            ref={triggerRef}
            {...triggerProps}
            iconBefore={<MoreIcon label="Card actions" size="small" />}
            spacing="compact"
          />
        </Tooltip>
      )}
    >
      <DropdownItemGroup>
        <DropdownItem isDisabled={isFirstRow} onClick={moveUp}>
          Move up
        </DropdownItem>
        <DropdownItem isDisabled={isLastRow} onClick={moveDown}>
          Move down
        </DropdownItem>
      </DropdownItemGroup>
    </DropdownMenu>
  );
}
```

#### Drag handle button

A variant of action buttons is a drag handle button. It functions as both a drag handle and a menu button.

We have created an [optional convenience package](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/packages/react-accessibility/about) for creating drag handle buttons in React. This includes a plain drag handle button, as well as a drag handle with a dropdown menu already wired up.

### Modal dialogs

Modals are an alternative to the `DropDownMenu` approach. Rather than your action button triggering a `DropDownMenu`, your action button can trigger a `Modal`. A `Modal` can be used to to power more complex interactions. For example:

- Interactions that require user input
- Interactions that require multiple choices to be made

### Inline buttons

Buttons can be placed inside draggable items, providing directional input. This is useful for free movement experiences such as diagrams and drawing.

### Toggles

Toggles can be used to show or hide edit controls.

This pattern can be combined with other patterns.

### Select and move

A move mode can be triggered where only drop targets are focusable/clickable.

The item(s) being moved are selected, then an anchor item is chosen. Item(s) are moved above or below the anchor item.

## Screen Reader Messaging

After an action has been performed by an assistive technology friendly control, it is important that you let the user know what has occurred by announcing what occurred to screen readers.

```ts
import { announce } from '@atlaskit/live-region';

function onReorderItem({
  item,
  startIndex,
  newIndex,
}: {
  item: { label: string };
  startIndex: number;
  newIndex: number;
}) {
  // reorder item in state to update UI


  // let screen reader users know what has occurred
  announce(
    `You've moved ${item.label} from position ${startIndex + 1} to position ${
      newIndex + 1
    } of ${items.length}.`,
  );
}
```

## Focus restoration

If your accessible control is moving an entity from one position in an interface to another (for example, a card from one column to another), you should restore focus on the moved entity.By doing this, a user can continue to interact with the same entity quickly after the operation.
