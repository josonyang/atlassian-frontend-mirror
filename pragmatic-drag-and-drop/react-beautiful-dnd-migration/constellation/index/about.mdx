This package allows rapid migration from `react-beautiful-dnd` to Pragmatic drag and drop (`@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop`).

<SectionMessage>

This package depends on:

- [the core package](/components/drag-and-drop/core-package)
- [the hitbox package](/components/drag-and-drop/optional-packages/hitbox)
- [the live region package](/components/drag-and-drop/optional-packages/live-region)
- [the react-beautiful-dnd auto scroll package](/components/drag-and-drop/optional-packages/react-beautiful-dnd-autoscroll)
- [`react`](https://react.dev/)
- [`@emotion/react`](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling
- [`@atlaskit/tokens`](/components/tokens) for colors

</SectionMessage>

This package exposes the same exports and types of `react-beautiful-dnd@13` and uses `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` to power those exports.

At a high level, all you need to do is swap your imports of `react-beautiful-dnd` in your code to `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration` and your drag and drop experience(s) will now be powered by Pragmatic drag and drop.

This package also includes a codemod to help automatically shift over `react-beautiful-dnd@12` and `react-beautiful-dnd@13` to `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration`.

## Prerequisites

To use `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration` you should:

1. Already be using `react-beautiful-dnd`. If this is a new feature, adopt `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` directly.
2. Be using major version 12 or 13 of `react-beautiful-dnd`.
