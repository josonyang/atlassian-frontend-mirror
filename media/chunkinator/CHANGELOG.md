## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#60352](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/60352)
  [`ff9488b450dd`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/ff9488b450dd) -
  WHAT: Media has removed the ability to probe for existing file chunks.  
  WHY: This is to support the work to deprecate SHA1 usage and make the Media Platform comply with
  FedRAMP moderate controls. HOW: Remove any calls you have directly to probing, instead upload all
  files directly. If you upload files via MediaPicker no changes are required.
