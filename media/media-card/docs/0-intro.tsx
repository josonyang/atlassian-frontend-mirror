  ### Error UI Design Matrix for Media Card

  In the past we have refactored the list of Media Card's error UI in 4 categories: \`Generic Error\`, \`Rate Limited Error\`, \`Polling Max Attempts Error\` and \`Upload Error\`.
  All of this is available to be previewed in Card View Matrix example page.

  The list of the error UI design can be referenced [here](https://product-fabric.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MEX/pages/3070230558/New+Error+UI+design+for+Media+Card+new+experience).
