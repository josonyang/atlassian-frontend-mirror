# Feature Flagging
- Feature Gate is synonymous to feature flag
- To do fetaure gating first need to import `import { fg } from '@atlaskit/platform-feature-flags';`
- to evaluate fature gate: `fg('fg-name')` it returns boolean
- if fg is used in if, put the fg check as last condition of the if statement e.g. `if (a===b && fg('my_fg'))`
- feature gates need to be registered in [package.json](mdc:platform/packages/react-ufo/atlaskit/package.json)
